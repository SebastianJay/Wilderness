#Backstory
The game universe is a planet that is a "shell" -- it is hollow on the inside such that civilizations can exist on the outer and inner surfaces (called Outer and Inner, respectively). Neither side knows of the existence of the other. Every 1000 years, a hole naturally develops between the two sides over the course of several months, creating a tunnel between the two surfaces. Once the hole is formed, the planet inverts itself -- Inner rises to become the Outer, and Outer crumbles to eventually become Inner (the process is called Terraforming). Some civilizations on Inner are strong enough to survive Terraforming, but those on Outer perish. Afterward the tunnel between the two sides is sealed once again.

1000 years before the events of the game, a warrior from Outer survives Terraforming -- now in Inner, he creates a series of artifacts to describe the existence of the other side. After 500 years, an empire develops and comes upon these artifacts; the power-hungry emperor conspires to create a tunnel preemptively and conquer Outer. However, the empire falls (due to populist uprising) before they make progress. Unknown to most people, though, the empire creates a crystal ball that can both halt Terraforming and devastate Outer when it is cast through the tunnel. Some high-ranking officials are privy to this info and secretly create an altar that, when holding the crystal ball, will fill the void of the planet, destroying Inner while saving Outer.

After the empire's fall, Inner becomes filled with small, self-sufficient, peaceful communities. Most people are blue-collar workers who rely on strength and self-taught skills to get by. Kipp, a spirited young man, hails from a farm east of the Wilderness, where the hole first appears.

After Terraforming 1000 years before the game, Outer repopulates and thrives under universities which advance the sciences and humanity's capabilities. Some technologies like aerospace and computing are not advanced, but others like biological and genetic engineering are. Outer's engineering capabilities allow several large cities to develop and create nearly unlimited food and shelter for its people. A sort of utopia arises; however, it comes at the cost of smaller communities in the surrounding areas. In order to produce resources, the planet must be drained, rendering most places outside the cities inhospitable. In the big picture, a relatively small number of people (who choose to live outside) suffer -- however, these people have a deep resentment towards city-folk.

One researcher in a university west of the Wilderness specializes in radio technology, and uses her skills to secretly experiment on her baby. Unknown to herself, she makes the child (Lore) a telepath. Lore's abilities are latent and only work with certain people; in the game she can only connect with Kipp. Otherwise, they have no obvious side effects. Lore grows up and studies at the same university and drops out when her mother falls ill and eventually dies.

#Game story
The backstory should only be revealed toward the end of the game. In the early game each character wants to travel to the Wilderness for personal reasons (Kipp is seeking adventure; Lore is seeking closure). See the plot docs for the major branching points.

Kipp will discover his mission as he travels with his companion (whether it's through the companion himself or through artifacts) -- his companion will affect the way he perceives Inner and Outer (and which one is worth saving). The Derelict wants to save Outer, the Fugitive wants to save Inner, and the Brother presents a balanced view. Eventually Kipp will make a journey to the altar by himself.

Lore will realize her telepathic connection after the jet ride to the Wilderness. She will also learn of a scientific explanation for Terraforming from a makeshift research lab onsite -- they hypothesize of the planet's shell structure but do not imagine any civilizations exist on the other side. They engineer a device (called Fissure) that sends targeted waves underground to slow the planet's seismic activity, and potentially halt Terraforming; however, it will likely destroy Inner as well. On Lore's arrival the device is complete, but the engineers are waiting for a go-ahead to deploy it. Lore, aware of Kipp's journey but not of his intentions, sneaks into the Fissure facility.

## Endgame
Lore can decide to preemptively activate Fissure, assuring Inner's destruction, or to sabotage the device by feeding it junk data, saving Inner but leaving the fate of her own world uncertain.

Kipp will find the altar at a cliffside that overlooks the sinkhole, and can decide whether to toss the crystal ball into the tunnel (saving Inner) or whether to place it on the altar (saving Outer).

### Good end (All is saved)
Fissure is stopped, but Kipp places the crystal on the altar. Rain begins to fall. The player gains control of Lore as her visions of the events of Inner inform her that Kipp's world will become inundated. Filled with compassion, Lore and friends locate planes parked at camp and fly through the tunnel. They rescue nearly everyone on Inner from the flooding; at the last moment Lore locates Kipp and saves him.

Several years pass, and the Wilderness is now an oasis filled with clear water from the planet's core. Outer is now fertile and hospitable to all, both those in the cities and in the country. The game closes on a true picture of peace.

### Neutral end (Lore & Kipp save Outer)
As Kipp places the crystal on the altar, the effects of Fissure can be felt through earthquakes that cleave the land on Inner. Terraforming eventually halts at the cost of all people on Inner perishing. Outer survives and thrives as society becomes technologically more potent. People living on the outskirts of the cities either perish or are assimilated into the modern way of life.

### Neutral end (Lore & Kipp save Inner)
Stopping Fissure buys enough time for the crystal to travel through the tunnel -- when it reaches its terminal velocity it creates a violent explosion that causes a nuclear winter on Outer. Inner survives and thrives under an agrarian society; from a technological and cultural standpoint, society is stagnant, but in other respects all is well.

### Bad end (All is destroyed)
As Fissure tears apart Inner, Kipp realizes that the crystal falling through the abyss may not reach its target due to seismic activity in the tunnel. Knowing his world is doomed, the player gains control of Kipp as he descends through the hole and locates the crystal on a ledge. Holding the ball tight to his body, Kipp dives through the cave, ensuring Outer's fate is also sealed.
