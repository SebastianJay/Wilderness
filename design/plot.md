# Backstory

The game universe is a planet that is a "shell" -- it is hollow on the inside such that civilizations can exist on the outer and inner surfaces (called Outer and Inner, respectively). Neither side knows of the existence of the other. Every 1000 years, a hole naturally develops between the two sides over the course of several months, creating a tunnel between the two surfaces. Once the hole is formed, the planet inverts itself -- Inner rises to become the Outer, and Outer crumbles to eventually become Inner. Imagine a snake shedding its skin; we'll call this process Terraforming. Some civilizations on Inner are strong enough to survive Terraforming, but those on Outer perish. Afterward the tunnel between the two sides is sealed once again.

1000 years before the events of the game, a warrior from Outer survives Terraforming -- now in Inner, he creates a series of artifacts (e.g. cave art) to describe the existence of the other side. After 500 years, an empire develops and comes upon these artifacts; the power-hungry emperor conspires to create a tunnel preemptively and conquer Outer. However, the empire falls (due to populist uprising) before they make progress, and knowledge of the other world is lost. Unknown to most people, the empire creates a crystal ball that can both halt Terraforming and devastate Outer when it is cast through the tunnel. High-ranking officials are privy to this info and secretly create an altar that, when holding the crystal ball, will fill the void of the planet, destroying Inner while saving Outer.

After the empire's fall, Inner becomes filled with small, self-sufficient, peaceful communities. Most people are blue-collar workers who rely on strength and self-taught skills to get by. Kipp, a spirited young man, hails from a farm east of the Wilderness, where the hole first appears.

After Terraforming 1000 years before the game, Outer repopulates and thrives under universities which advance the sciences and humanity's capabilities. Some technologies like aerospace and computing are not advanced, but others like biological and genetic engineering are. Outer's engineering capabilities allow several large cities to develop and create nearly unlimited food and shelter for its people. A sort of utopia arises; however, it comes at the cost of smaller communities in the surrounding areas. In order to produce resources, the planet must be drained of water, rendering most places outside the cities inhospitable. In the big picture, a relatively small number of people (who choose to live outside) suffer -- however, these people have a deep resentment towards city-folk.

One researcher (Juniper) in a university west of the Wilderness specializes in radio technology, and uses her skills to secretly experiment on her baby. Unknown to herself, she makes the child (Lore) a telepath. Lore's abilities are latent and only work with certain people; in the game she can only connect with Kipp. Otherwise, they have no obvious side effects. Lore grows up and studies at the same university and drops out when her mother falls ill and eventually dies.

# In-game Plot

The backstory should only be revealed toward the end of the game. In the early game each character wants to travel to the Wilderness for personal reasons (Kipp is seeking adventure; Lore is seeking closure).

The game begins a six weeks after a sinkhole in the Wilderness has been discovered, and initial readings show that within two months the major civilizations surrounding the area will be engulfed as the hole grows larger. Each protagonist, Kipp and Lore, resolves to travel to the Wilderness. _The gamer will start with Lore's story first._

One main plot point is that the two protagonists are telepathically connected, although they are not aware of it. The actions that one protagonist takes will be unconsciously picked up by another, subtly affecting his/her perception of the events in that storyline.

The [characters document](characters.md) contains more details about the branching storylines as it pertains to each character.

### Lore Storyline

Lore's first step is figuring out how to the Wilderness. A system of roads connects ~3 cities together but no roads exist straight there (offroad driving is not an option). Lore's friends direct her attention to a local entrepreneur (Rodnin) who heads an environmental research and compliance company is known to have a private jet. Planes in general are a rarity, and those owned by the governments are provisioned for evacuation purposes. But perhaps there is a way to convince this man to send a plane the opposite way?

_The gamer must have progressed with Kipp at this point to make progress in this storyline._

Because of Rodnin's familiarity with Lore's mother, he gives Lore a position working in the lab. He also allows all parties interested in his plane to meet with him and make their pitch; in a week's time he will decide who can take the plane.

_The gamer will be placed on one of three paths depending on actions with Kipp._

##### Heroism

Lore recruits some classmates from university (Rune, Quen, Essa) that would be interested in doing research on determining the cause of the crisis and searching for a solution (Lore herself feigns belief in this purpose). Together they build up a case to prove that they are competent engineers who have an out-of-the-box approach. Lore commits herself to the cause and their group succeeds in convincing Rodnin.

##### Friendship

Lore looks for ways to penetrate Rodnin's inner circle. She singles out one of his friends (Hal) who happens to be her neighbor. Together, they conceive of a rescue operation to find those isolated along the perimeter of the Wilderness and fly them out to safety. Rodnin agrees to this purpose, but Lore confides with Hal that she wants to be left behind during this mission.

##### Villanny

Lore conspires to steal the plane herself. She gathers materials and makes plans so that the following week she is able to take the aircraft without Rodnin immediately noticing.

On reaching the Wilderness, Lore gains awareness that dreams/visions she has been having (of Kipp) are becoming more vivid and could in fact be linked to real life. Even so, she cannot figure out their meaning. Lore reaches an encampment of researchers who contend that a previously inert force from within the planet has become active and that the planet's collapse may be part of a natural Terraforming process that occurs periodically. On hearing this theory, Lore realizes that the stranger in her dreams is actually an inhabitant on the other side of the planet -- that is, the planet is actually a shell with two surfaces: the outer one that she lives on, and the inner one (in which gravity is "inverted") that Kipp lives on.

A confidant (Viva) reveals to Lore that the government has been investing in a large machine, called Fissure, which will send targeted waves underground to slow the planet's seismic activity and potentially halt Terraforming; however, she has concerns about this approach (it could irreversibly harm Outer's landscape and might not even work). Lore knows the process will likely devastate Inner, but knows about Kipp's mission to the Wilderness as well. Viva is so disillusioned with the process that she allows Lore to sneak into the Fissure facility.

### Kipp Storyline

It is Kipp's father's birthday. After a peaceful night with the family, Kipp declares that he wants to leave home and journey to the Wilderness. His parents (Tiko and Flora) are distraught, and after some arguing, they part ways (not on good terms). Kipp's brother (Rice), however, is at peace with the decision.

As an outdoorsman, Kipp is able to travel the world by foot, and he passes through a number of small settlements. He reaches a nexus from where he must venture more or less straight into the wasteland. One person will accompany him on the journey.

_The gamer will be placed on one of three paths, which is determined by progress with Lore._

##### Derelict

Kipp finds an injured man (Alodar) on the wayside and nurses him back to health. The (somewhat eccentric) man identifies himself as a magician, even though magic is a myth. Kipp humors him, and the two decide to set off together.

##### Brothers

Rice finds Kipp. He explains that their parents were distraught after he left and did not want him to leave with bad blood between them, and so he volunteered to be an escort for the journey.

##### Fugitive

A wild-looking woman (Jinx) accosts Kipp and claims that she is a runaway who was framed for a violent crime she did not commit. She forces Kipp to help her along; later events cause them to mutually continue together.

_Dialogue/story in this section of the game largely involves Kipp and the companion._

---

During the journey Kipp encounters artifacts that reveal the nature of Terraforming. Kipp's companion tells him about an artifact (a crystal ball) that has the power to save or destroy Inner with the reverse result for Outer. At this point Kipp has a suspicion that the woman in her dreams is on the other side.

_The gamer must have progressed with Lore at this point to make progress in this storyline._

At some point during the final ascent Kipp must continue alone (perhaps the companion gets injured). He reaches a height overlooking the spreading destruction with the crystal in hand.

## Endgame

Lore can decide to preemptively activate Fissure, assuring Inner's destruction, or to sabotage the device by feeding it junk data, saving Inner but leaving the fate of her own world uncertain.

Kipp will find the altar at a cliffside that overlooks the sinkhole, and can decide whether to toss the crystal ball into the tunnel (saving Inner) or whether to place it on the altar (saving Outer).

### Good end (All is saved)

Fissure is stopped, but Kipp places the crystal on the altar. Rain begins to fall in Inner. The player gains control of Lore as her visions of the events of Inner inform her that Kipp's world will become inundated. Filled with compassion, Lore and friends locate planes parked at camp and fly through the tunnel. They rescue nearly everyone on Inner from the flooding; at the last moment Lore locates Kipp and saves him.

Several years pass, and the Wilderness is now an oasis filled with clear water from the planet's core. Outer is now fertile and hospitable to all, both those in the cities and in the country. The game closes on a true picture of peace.

### Neutral end (Lore & Kipp save Outer)

As Kipp places the crystal on the altar, the effects of Fissure can be felt through earthquakes that cleave the land on Inner. Terraforming eventually halts at the cost of all people on Inner perishing. Outer survives and thrives as society becomes technologically more potent. People living on the outskirts of the cities either perish or are assimilated into the modern way of life.

### Neutral end (Lore & Kipp save Inner)

Stopping Fissure buys enough time for the crystal to travel through the tunnel -- when it reaches its terminal velocity it creates a violent explosion that causes a nuclear winter on Outer. Inner survives and thrives under an agrarian society; from a technological and cultural standpoint, society is stagnant, but in other respects all is well.

### Bad end (All is destroyed)

As Fissure tears apart Inner, Kipp realizes that the crystal falling through the abyss may not reach its target due to seismic activity in the tunnel. Knowing his world is doomed, the player gains control of Kipp as he descends through the hole and locates the crystal on a ledge. Holding the ball tight to his body, Kipp dives through the cave, ensuring Outer's fate is also sealed.
