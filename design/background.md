# Setting

A planet very similar to Earth, but with greater surface area (2x to 3x) and more landmass compared to ocean (1:1 ratio between the two). A great deal of the land is infertile and generally uninhabitable, but even so there is plenty of space for civilizations to thrive -- they are just spread out more than they are on Earth. Governance is typically representative democracies on a per-civilization basis, though some international bodies exist to maintain trade relations, build infrastructure (e.g. roads), and keep peace. The workforces consist largely of farmers, ranchers, merchants, and other non-professionals. In most communities children attend a state-sponsored school for grades 1-10. Those who attend college (partially subsidized) afterward typically become researchers, engineers, managers, etc. and many travel between civilizations.

Technologically, people have many of the conveniences of the present day, with some key differences. First, rocketry is only starting to become a reality, with just a couple unmanned flights having succeeded. Likewise, airplanes are not available for the commercial public -- automobiles are the primary mode of transport. Radio communications are limited to nonexistent, although a wired connection exists between most civilizations to deliver TV, telephone, and Internet (albeit in primitive forms).

Culturally, people find enjoyment in entertainment such as music, TV, and movies. Some professional sports leagues exist but are not as built up as they are on Earth. People do outdoors activities as well -- most civilizations are near water, so there's boating, fishing, etc., but some also camp out in the wastelands outside town.

A large portion of wasteland, called the Wilderness, is our focus for the game. Groups of civilizations exist on the east and west part -- the West is more urban and developed while the East is the countryside. _The gamer initially believes that_ two protagonists hail from either end and will journey towards the center.

## Glossary

This section describes locations and terms made up to lay out the setting of the game.

### Sharlee

Sharlee (SHAR-lee) is a farming community and Kipp's home. Its soil is fertile enough to grow different seasonal crops year-round; some raise sheep, cattle, and other barnyard animals. It is far removed from urban civilizations. The only contact from the outside is wealthy tourists and adventurers visiting the wildlands to the west, and traders who carry goods from Drymesa and other cities.

In-game, this area serves as a tutorial. Some character backstory is exposed. The setting is painted as peaceful but boring, a situation that Kipp wants to escape.

#### Intrepid

Intrepid is a school for the high achievers in the Sharlee area with a slant towards engineering. Rice attends this school; Kipp applied but did not get admission.

#### Drymesa

Drymesa (DRY-may-suh) is a city on Inner that is never reachable in-game, but is referenced several times as the closest bustling metropolis to Sharlee, Kipp's home (closest is a relative term, though; it is roughly 1500 miles away). It features wealth and extravagance as well as poverty and dire need; there is almost no middle class. The poor make a living as maids, servants, etc. for the wealthy, who make money off of access to water (and consequently food), an extremely scarce resource in the area. Only a fraction of the lower class make it into the upper class with hard work and plenty of luck; others save their money to immigrate elsewhere.

### Aspire

Aspire (ESS-pie-uhr) is an outpost connecting the Sharlee area to the northern mines (not reachable in-game). It has an Old West feel, with a saloon, library, bank, and gunshop.

In-game, this area has been taken over by a powerful individual who has forced various clans against each other. Each clan has its own base, Kipp must gain the trust of all three in order to depose the individual. It is revealed that this person was possessed by a "Spirit of the Beyond."

### Black Hills

Black Hills is a coal-mining community that is slowly dying as the workers move to mines up north. The remaining population is getting by on the hope of saving enough to move elsewhere and start a new life.

In-game, this area has recently had several mining accidents causing workplace injuries. Kipp must investigate, either teaming with the miners or the seedy foreman, until he uncovers a robot in the mines which has been disrupting the foundations.

### Kapallanoah Forest

Kapallanoah (CAP-uh-luh-NO-uh) Forest is a scenic location for advertised as a "true nature experience." It is also the last frontier before the uninhabited areas to the West (including the Wilderness).

In-game, this area is "empty" (i.e. has nothing special) until the previous areas have been cleared. The entrance is blocked until Kipp has cleared those areas. At the start, Kipp meets his companion. Together they construct a raft to clear the area. Along the way they brush with a villain from Maven who is inquiring about a crystal ball artifact.

### Lake Lochitt

Lake Lochitt (LOCK-it) is a cold, misty location that is home to mischievous spirits. Travelers who entertain them can ask for a favor, so long as their motives aren't malicious.

In-game, Kipp and company enter this area to ask the spirits for directions through Umbra. The spirits play some games that in turn accomplish the following devices:

* Learn more about Kipp's companion and strengthen the relationship between the two
* Reveal that the spirits originated from an era before the birth of this world
* Hint at a cataclysm (i.e. Terraforming) which happens periodically

### Umbra Prairie

Umbra Prairie is a labyrinthine set of hedges and fields with dimensional rifts that briefly transport travelers to areas outside of the world. It has recently become more dangerous with the Wilderness falling apart.

In-game, Kipp and company need the help of a spirit from Lake Lochitt to pass through. They encounter three different scenarios which demonstrate Kipp's character to his companion. At the end of the area, Kipp's companion reveals their greater purpose for tagging along.

### Plutia Mountains

Plutia (PLOO-shuh) Mountains once had a passable set of trails to continue West, but the Wilderness collapse has exposed less traversed valleys and caves within the mountains.

In-game, this area has a number of small rooms to solve, until Kipp and company encounter a series of ancient cave drawings depicting the Terraforming process. Kipp hypothesizes the existence of Outer and people on the other side. The companion has stronger conviction in the location of the crystal ball -- in Rust Desert

### Rust Desert

Rust Desert is a small sandy area in the arid parts of the Wilderness. It is home to a hidden mausoleum which contains the crystal ball.

In-game, this area features a large puzzle which grants Kipp and company the crystal ball. On exit, they are accosted by the same villain from Maven along with two others. After a skirmish, the enemies are defeated, but Kipp's companion must stay behind to recuperate. Kipp must proceed alone.

### Frontier

The final area in Kipp's story: the edge of the spreading sinkhole. In-game, this area is linear, with an altar at the end where Kipp makes a decision on the fate of the other side.

### Maven

Maven is the collective name of a few shadowy individuals in Inner who are looking for the crystal ball artifact (as well as Jinx, for her knowledge of it). They hope to leverage the crystal's power for their own gain. Kipp encounters one member in Kapallanoah Forest, and meets him again along with a couple others in Rust Desert.

### Aevontide

Aevontide (AY-vun-tide) is the name of the region Lore is from. It contains a bustling downtown as well as residential suburbs.

Downtown features industrial, shopping, business, and historic districts as well as a park.

Suburbs features the homes of Lore, Hal, Essa, and others, a bus stop to exit, and a connection to the slums area that has refused adoption of government land control.

### Aevon State University

aka ASU, or just University (there are no others in close proximity). ASU is partially state-sponsored; its strongest program is engineering, but it also has schools for liberal arts, education, and architecture. In addition to classrooms and dorms, the campus has faculty offices, gym, observatory, arcade, dining hall, shop (for essentials), and library. The outskirts of campus have some hidden areas relevant to the storyline.

### Excomo

The name of Rodnin's organization that monitors environmental health and helps devise state policy to promote it. With the collapse of the Wilderness, the company became much more focused on researching that region and finding any root cause for the disaster.
