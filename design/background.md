# Setting

A planet very similar to Earth, but with greater surface area (2x to 3x) and more landmass compared to ocean (1:1 ratio between the two). A great deal of the land is infertile and generally uninhabitable, but even so there is plenty of space for civilizations to thrive -- they are just spread out more than they are on Earth. Governance is typically representative democracies on a per-civilization basis, though some international bodies exist to maintain trade relations, build infrastructure (e.g. roads), and keep peace. The workforces consist largely of farmers, ranchers, merchants, and other non-professionals. In most communities children attend a state-sponsored school for grades 1-10. Those who attend college (partially subsidized) afterward typically become researchers, engineers, managers, etc. and many travel between civilizations.

Technologically, people have many of the conveniences of the present day, with some key differences. First, rocketry is only starting to become a reality, with just a couple unmanned flights having succeeded. Likewise, airplanes are not available for the commercial public -- automobiles are the primary mode of transport. Radio communications are limited to nonexistent, although a wired connection exists between most civilizations to deliver TV, telephone, and Internet (albeit in primitive forms).

Culturally, people find enjoyment in entertainment such as music, TV, and movies. Some professional sports leagues exist but are not as built up as they are on Earth. People do outdoors activities as well -- most civilizations are near water, so there's boating, fishing, etc., but some also camp out in the wastelands outside town.

A large portion of wasteland, called the Wilderness, is our focus for the game. Groups of civilizations exist on the east and west part -- the West is more urban and developed while the East is the countryside. _The gamer initially believes that_ two protagonists hail from either end and will journey towards the center.

## Glossary

This section describes locations and terms made up to lay out the setting of the game.

### Charli

#### Intrepid

#### Druryan

Druryan (DRURE-ee-uhn) is a city on Inner that is never reachable in-game, but is referenced several times as the closest bustling metropolis to Charli, Kipp's home (closest is a relative term, though; it is roughly 1500 miles away). It features wealth and extravagance as well as poverty and dire need; there is almost no middle class. The poor make a living as maids, servants, etc. for the wealthy, who make money off of access to water (and consequently food), an extremely scarce resource in the area. Only a fraction of the lower class make it into the upper class, while others save enough money to immigrate elsewhere.
