# Characters

This page describes the personalities and backstories of the major characters in the game, interpolating the game's plot where important.

### Kipp
###### Protagonist from "East" (Inner) - spirited and brash

Kipp (age 20, rhymes with "lip") grew up in the countryside, in a farm that grows grain and keeps cattle. He has a stable upbringing and loves his parents (Tiko and Flora) and younger brother (Rice) unconditionally. Together, they are self-sufficient, only needing the support of surrounding farms to get all the food they needed. After graduating school (called "Intrepid") at the age of 18, Kipp works as a farmhand at home, doing the hard labor that Tiko is starting to get too old to perform. It is implicitly understood that Kipp will inherit the farm; however, secretly he wants to leave home and go traveling. When the Wilderness opens up, he sees a prime opportunity for adventure.

### Rice
###### Kipp's mature younger brother

Rice (age 18, rhymes with "nice") is Kipp's junior but acts older and more mature than Kipp. He grew up along with Kipp on the family farm and is a high achiever at Intrepid, from where he will soon graduate. After graduation, he plans to apprentice under a local mechanic and eventually open a workshop at a distant city where he can invent and sell tools to automate many of the tasks of the farm. He often escapes his parents' scrunity due to his relative maturity over Kipp, though Tiko has vocally expressed grand expectations of the younger brother.

_If gamer's path has Rice as companion, it's revealed that_ Rice suffers from bouts of depression, but he has hidden this condition from his parents, and even his brother, under the fear that they may become over-protective and/or restrain his freedom post-graduation. Rice's depression manifests itself with insomnia and moods of apathy and becomes apparent to Kipp during the journey; together they open up to each other and Rice discovers a feeling of self-worth that helps him cope.

When the two learn of the Terraforming process, Rice gives Kipp a letter from Tiko describing how, in his youth, he overheard his parents speaking intently of an artifact that could save or destroy Inner. Rice presents his own balanced view from both sides and commits the decision to Kipp, trusting his brother's judgment over his own.

### Tiko
###### Kipp's brusque but well-meaning father

Tiko (age 52, TIE-coh) is Kipp's and Rice's father. He conquered turmoil in his youth to carve out a peaceful existence on the farm. Though he doesn't talk about it, he suspects his parents were involved with a shady business that eventually did them in. All he remembers was getting pushed out the door of his home in a distant city (called Druryan) one night with directions to a plot of land that would become the farm; he never returned to his old home, but heard reports of a fire that consumed several homes in the neighborhood. Life in the country was different, and he initially had no idea what he was doing. The neighbor's kid (Flora) taught him the ropes; their relationship grew, and they became man and wife.

_In Rice's storyline, it is revealed that_ Tiko's parents were government intelligence operatives who had infiltrated a secret society (called Maven), which had learned of the ancient crystal ball artifact and was intent on leveraging it to create a totalitarian state. They were caught, but managed to assure their son's safety.

Tiko is terse and transparent in his view of how things should be; the rest of the family accepts his authority (after all, he is usually reasonable!). He tends to give Kipp more of a hard time than Rice but is never rude or overbearing.

### Flora
###### Kipp's gentle mother

Flora (age 46, FLORE-uh) is Kipp's and Rice's mother. She grew up as an only child on the plot next to Tiko's, and inherited her parents' farm which merged with Tiko's. She claims her family lived around the area since the beginning of time and has few stories to share of her youth.

Flora balances Tiko's brusque nature with warmth and compassion, though she does tend to worry about her two boys and overreact if they're remotely close to trouble. That being said, she respects Kipp's and Rice's freedom to plot their own futures, unlike Tiko.

### Alodar
###### Wise, eccentric old man

Alodar (age unknown, AL-oh-dahr) is a self-proclaimed magician who Kipp encounters on one path in the forest. He appears wounded on the side of the road; Kipp helps him recover, and the two set off together. He is renowned in some regions for his spectacular tricks, though adults know it's just smoke and mirrors. He is just as likely to wax poetic and profound as he is to spout non-sequiturs.

As the journey continues, it is revealed that Alodar is a survivor of the empirical era from 500 years ago, though due to his injury he forgot many of the details of his past life -- all he remembers at the point he meets Kipp is that the another world exists and he needs to protect that world from an impending disaster. He does not volunteer that information, though, until the two discover the nature of Terraforming and how Inner would be destroyed. At this point, Alodar remembers: he and others were forced under duress to devise the weapon that would destroy Outer, but their hope of a better world on the other side propelled them to also create the opposite.

Present day is different, and Alodar's perspective has changed, mainly because of Kipp. In the end, Alodar still wants to save Outer out of a sense of altruism; however, he lets Kipp have the final say.

### Jinx
###### Vivacious fugitive

Jinx (age 23, rhymes with "lynx") is a runaway who Kipp encounters on one path in the forest. She forces him to be her accessory so that she can outrun the authorities. However, it is revealed that a villainous force (called Maven) is after her as well -- the same force that was responsible for Tiko's parents' demise.

As the journey continues, Jinx tells her full backstory: she acted as a guardian of about a dozen children in the Druryan slums. She worked as a stewardess/concierge for the upper crust but would often commit petty larceny to make ends meet. One of her clients was rumored to have been close to death, and had a massive fortune of ancient artifacts to disburse among his heirs. Jinx conspired to steal just a small part of that treasure. The night she attempted the burglary, though, she found the client already dead (murdered) and the vault open and mostly empty. At that moment, the client's son entered and noticed her; panicked, she grabbed what she could -- some documents and small gems -- and fled. She left the gems with a friend for the benefit of the children, but still has the documents, which tell of an artifact that can either destroy or save Inner -- she made it her mission to find it and do the latter (think of the children!).

Jinx is emotionally distant, covering her feelings under a facade of rowdy self-assuredness. She and Kipp develop a friendly-bordering-on-romantic relationship over the progress of the game, causing her to entrust the decision of which world to save to Kipp.

### Lore
###### Protagonist from "West" (Outer) - stoic and even-keel

Lore (age 22) grew up in a city under the support of a single mother (Juniper) who made a living off research in biology at the cellular level. At her mother's urging (and with her financial support), she attends university after finishing the mandated class requirements; she decides to become a biomedical engineer. Partway through, her mother is stricken with a debilitating disease that keeps her at home. Lore quits college and, against her mother's wishes, uses her tuition to pay for her mother's treatment. Despite her efforts, her mother perishes. Lacking the resources to finish school, Lore gets by on a job she is overqualified for -- several months pass before the Wilderness opens up. Feeling that no one will find a viable solution, she decides to confront the crisis head on and find closure rather than (as many people are doing) running away.

### Rodnin
###### Charismatic entrepreneur

Rodnin (age 33, ROD-nin) is an executive of a firm (Excomo) that maintains environmental protocol for the city, conducting tests of the air, water, and soil. The government has asked his company to study the Wilderness, so he has operatives go there, collect data, and return. He owns a plane (a rare item) which Lore uses (through different possibilities described in the plot doc) to get to the Wilderness.

Rodnin has paternal feelings toward Lore since he worked under Juniper as a student. He speaks concisely and directly and can quickly analyze others' thoughts and behaviors. He is unmarried and has no partner, which leads to some speculation by the gossipy types. He is typically persuaded through facts and sound reasoning.

### Hal
###### Chivalrous handyman

Hal (age 35, rhymes with "pal") is Lore's neighbor whose past is unknown until it is revealed later on that he worked as an operative for Rodnin in the Wilderness. Before that, he worked several years in Excomo as a "field agent" conducting tests. He left the company after Rodnin professed feelings that Hal did not reciprocate.

Hal is virtuous to a fault, always seeing matters from others' perspectives and lending a hand when possible.

### Quen
###### Lore's diligent, straight-shooting friend

Quen (age 21, rhymes with "when") is a down-to-business, organized, and intellectual type, with a perhaps overly inflated ego. He is studying history and anthropology. He lives at the university, but faces discrimination due to his lack of interest in STEM. He is well versed in the history of the urban-suburban conflict, and provides a neutral perspective on that.

### Essa
###### Lore's comical, compassionate friend

Essa (age 23, ESS-uh) is a blunt, comedic, character who is overly passionate about everything, especially her friends. She is majoring in physics. She lives in the suburbs and comes from a broken family; her father is addicted to drugs, and her mother is depressed and suicidal. She has a little sister who she fiercely protects (which makes it hard to convince her to join Lore on her quest to the Wilderness, should she choose the Hero path.) She provides a suburban perspective.

### Rune
###### Lore's quiet, bookish friend

Rune (age 19, rhymes with "noon") is a frail, soft-spoken girl majoring in chemistry. She is a walking encyclopedia. She commutes to the university from her family's apartment in the city (Shopping District). She provides an urban perspective.

### Viva
###### Rogue researcher

Viva (age 55, VEE-vuh) is a researcher Lore meets at the Wilderness who disapproves of the development of the Fissure machine as the solution to the growing sinkhole. She is confined to a wheelchair and lacks the mobility to take action, but she trusts Lore enough to allow her into the facility. Her snark and sarcasm hides her genuine passion for finding the correct solution to the planet's crisis.
