It took a while before Kipp started talking about the adventure again.\n\nKipp: All I wanted to do was fulfill my dream travel and explore what the world had to offer outside of my home.\nJinx: And how's that fantasy going?\nKipp: It's now a nightmare with a side of death trap with every new place we venture into, and it's weird. I remember that town back there being a hustle and bustle center, not shot up and ambushed.\nJinx: That sounds normal to me.\nKipp: Then a criminal shows up begging me not to turn you in.\nJinx: Begging...in your dreams, and I told you I'm not the one who killed that person.\nKipp: Now a random person in the forest jumps us and tells us the news about a Wilderness.\nJinx: Maybe he's just one of those crazy druids that are fond of nature.\nKipp: Well that doesn't mean...\n\nJinx interrupts Kipp.\n\nJinx: Well maybe I just don't know, Kipp! I was on the run and I bumped into you out of pure chance. This isn't fate, this just stupid luck. You could have just said no to me and walked away back there, it's not like I was in any position to pummel you. Now can we just move on so that we can go our separate ways?\nThe two were then silent and they chose to keep it that way. Kipp and his companion covered miles walking aimlessly, looking for any sign of where to go next.\n\nKipp: Do you know where we're going.\n\nJinx was silent; tired of both Kipp and the journey.\n\nKipp: Kay. Great. Thanks.\nKipp: Man, these grounds are so peaceful.\nKipp: You know, I've heard this is the stomping grounds of the Chikasi Clan.\n\nThe companion made a sound that either meant \"Oh\" or \"Whatever\".\n\nKipp: Yeah, they would hunt really big game, and would sometimes follow them until they found a new place to settle a small village. I guess they had other business than just being a whole gang and all.\nJinx: Yeah, well me and the Rune Raiders never see them 'round these parts.\nKipp:You know the raiders?\nJinx: Me and Mohani are first cousins...\nKipp: That explains a lot.\nJinx: I'll let that slide. So Mohani showed me this powder. Told me to think of a place and toss it. I tossed the bag and a shot of lightning came out of nowhere. A portal showed up and I walked into it. Sent me to a place like this one. I looked around and I thought the dust didn't get it right, but another portal opened, and I somehow I ended up at the greatest place in my life.\nKipp: Which was...\nJinx: Not happening.\nKipp: Oh. Well, I still will never understand magic.\n\nThey continued walking for another two miles until the reached the first hill in site. They climbed the hill and Kipp covered his eyes from the sunlight.\n\nKipp: I think I see...\nJinx: The speck you call your brain?\nKipp: Very Funny. No, I see...\nKipp squinted to see a person dressed in a shepherd's outfit laying on the ground...\n\nKipp: ...a person. Wait.\n\nKipp then bobbed his head further to see a pack of wolves in front of the shepherd.\n\nKipp: Oh no. Jinx we have to save him, or her, or...whatever, we just have to go!\nJinx: Right behind you.\nPerson: Help! Someone!\n\nAs they got closer, they were able to make out the cry for help.\n\nPerson: Please! I would take them out myself, but I left everything inside my home!\nJinx: Kipp, you run into the house. I'll keep the wolves distracted.\nKipp: Gotcha.\n\nKipp ran into the entrance of the stone house and frantically looked around for anything that could help. There was not a lot to work with, but his mind narrowed the room down to two options: something delicious on the table, and something deadly on the wall.\nJinx: Kipp, let me get this through your thick skull: the shepherd isn't in the position for you to take your sweet time in there! Hurry up!\nKipp: Man, what do I pick?\nOkay so maybe not delicious for Kipp, but he eyes 3 cuts of shoulder from some large game on the table. What the shepherd does on her spare time Kipp will never know. Kipp stops pondering and grabs the hunks of meat. Kipp runs outside to get the wolves' attention. Because Kipp's arms were full, he couldn't see the steps on the front door and tripped.\nKipp face-plants onto the ground and eats a face full of dirt.\n\nJinx: Perfect.\n\nJinx runs up to Kipp grabs all three slabs, ands runs screaming into the forest. The wolves notice Jinx and follow her. Kipp gets up and checks with the shepherd.\n\nKipp: What just happened?\nShepherd: Your girlfriend just started running and screaming like a maniac with my dinner into the woods.\nKipp: Oh, sorry. Wait...\nShepherd: Just joking with you, I know you two aren't dating. And I'm still breathing and all my blood is still in my body.\nKipp: Good, I think.\n\nJinx walks out of the woods unscathed.\n\nJinx: What'd I miss?\nShepherd: Nothing.\nThe shepherd gets up with the assistance of Jinx.\n\nShepherd: Thanks you guys for taking care of that. I'm Sam. Pleasure to meet you both.\nKipp: Kipp and Jinx.\n\nJinx: How did you end up in this situation.\nSam: Ever since the Wilderness opened, the creatures have been acting unusual.\n\nKipp elbows Jinx.\n\nSam: Please, I need to ask you both another favor.\nKipp: Anything, it doesn't seem to be your day.\nSam: My sheep have wandered off from my home after they were sacred off by the wolves. Can you please find them.\nKipp: No problem. I happen to be an expert sheep herder.\nJinx: Really.\nKipp: Okay well at least they aren't scared of me when I approach them on the farm. Sometimes they get angry and kick, but they don't run away.\nSam: whispering Hey Jinx, is he...\nJinx: It's a long story.\nSam: Well if you head in that direction, you can go to the great Hedge Maze Entrance. I've never entered the maze, but I've heard it's quite strange.\nKipp: Sounds like an understatement in my book.\nSam: I'll trust you on that.\n\nLEVEL START!\n"}], "variables": {"derelictPts": "0", "forIntro": "1", "subUsedDresser": "1", "uniAtTable": "0", "subFedMarthi": "0", "uniFriendConversationOver": "1", "charliComplete": "1", "medIntroductionCounter": "1", "rodOfficeFloor": "0", "itemsgrabbedLorehouse": "4", "fugitivePts": "0", "subSawKeys": "1", "companionName": "Jinx", "talkedToHal": "1", "lightPts": "1", "farmap": "1", "frmIntro": "1", "brotherPts": "0", "uniTalkedToFriends": "1", "subClosetOpen": "1", "subFinishedLoreHouse": "1", "loreHouseIntro": "1", "companionF": "1", "loreMorality": "1", "companionB": "0", "subListen": "1"}, "playtime": 825.8237972032766, "activeProtagonistInd": 1}
