randomToken:
    name: random token
    description: "It's a little dirty from the dried mud stains, but you can make out a picture of a bottle with the description: \"Good for 1 drink.\""
fireAle:
    name: fire ale
    description: The description says, "Gives you the spirit of a fire breathing dragon." Maybe it's just an ad marketing trick, or maybe...
ticket:
    name: ticket
    description: It says, "ONE PHOENIX BOLT. Only acceptable at Aspire Saloon. This establishment is not responsible if fed to an actual phoenix." Wonder how they got that disclaimer on there.
phoenixBolt:
    name: Pheonix Bolt
    description: Says here that it's brewed with barley and the seeds of world's hottest pepper. How can anyone stomach this?
mohanisBullets:
    name: Mohani's bullets
    description: "I wonder why she would carve the number # on her shells?"
revolver:
    name: six-chamber revolver
    description: Strange how the Rune Raiders just let me have this. Guess magic is stronger than the mortal world. I have enough bullets for two reloads.
tomahawk:
    name: tomahawk
    description: Looks sharp enough to make a dent in a tree like our machete back home. Hopefully I won't have to test if it works with bodies, too.
