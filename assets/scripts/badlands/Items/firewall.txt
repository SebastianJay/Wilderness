			Kipp pulled out the fire extinguisher. He aimed at the base of the wall and doused the flames. The wall vanished in a matter of seconds.

			Kipp: I don't understand their logic.
			[companionName]: Weird. No story this time just one big picture.
			Kipp: Of an orb in a desert?
			[companionName]: Maybe we'll need to head there and retrieve it. 
			Kipp: Isn't that like trying to find a needle in the haystack? How big can that desert be?
			[companionName]: We were able to find sheep in an multi-dimensional hedge maze. I'm pretty sure we'll find a way.
			Kipp: I'll trust you on that. Oh, over on that sand dune. Someone in a cloak is drawing a @yellow{65}.
			[companionName]: Good to know.

		The player was actually that curious to see what happens when Kipp played with it. Kipp crouched near the base of the flames, grabbed a marshmallow from his backpack and a stick on the ground, and started roasting it. A fire spirit in the shape of a hand came from the wall, picked Kipp up, and slammed him on the ground. [companionName] got up and grabbed the fire extinguisher from Kipp's backpack. He pulled the pin and put out the small flames on Kipp's clothes.
		
		Kipp: Thanks.
		[companionName]: Can't say I told ya so.
