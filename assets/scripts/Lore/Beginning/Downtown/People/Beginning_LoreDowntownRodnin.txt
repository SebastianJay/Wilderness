		Rodnin: Thank you for coming. You must be surprised that I called you up so suddenly. Let me explain. You see, I worked with your mother back in the day. I was actually her lab assistant. I, uh... I'm sorry for your loss, by the way.

		Lore nodded in thanks.

		Rodnin: When your mother, well, when she became ill, she told me about you. She asked me to look out for you. I told her I was going to do research in the Wildnerness, but I promised that I would make sure you were safe. Your mother never introduced us, so I asked Hal, your neighbor, to keep an eye on you.
		Lore: I see.
		Rodnin: I know that all of this must seem weird to you. I am glad to finally meet you. But, you must have come to see me for a reason. What can I do for you?
			$Choice{
			I heard that you were hiring.|
				Rodnin: Ah, yes. I'm looking for someone to help around the lab. I have a team of researchers out in the field who send periodic updates, samples, back to the lab here. It's difficult to organize and analyze all the data myself, so I need an assistant. Are you interested in the position?
					$Choice{
					Yes.|
						Rodnin: Wonderful. You would work a minimum of thirty hours a week in the lab upstairs on the third floor. You would be responsible for organizing the data in our log, and doing the occasional soil analysis. The wage is hourly, starting at ten units per hour. Your mother was an excellent woman, and I assume the same from you. Consider yourself hired.
						Lore: Thank you, sir.
						Rodnin: Of course. If you'd like to take a look around the lab, it's upstairs. Also, if you have any questions about me or your mother, or anything at all, I'll be here.
						$set_begtalktoRodnin_eq_1
						$set_acceptedjob_eq_1
					|No.|
						Rodnin: I see. I wonder why you came all this way if you were not interested in the position?
						Lore: I was curious, but I don't think the job is for me.
						Rodnin: I understand. Still, your mother was an excellent woman. It would have been good to have you. Even if you don't work here, you're always welcome in the office. If you have any questions about me or your mother, or anything at all, I'll be here. Please let me know if you need anything.
						$set_begtalktoRodnin_eq_1|

					}
			|You've done research in the Wildnerness?|
				Rodnin: That's right. I've mostly studied changes in the environment due to the sinkhole. Rock formation, soil analysis, animal behavior. That kind of thing. You know, I'm looking for someone to help with my research. Would you be interested?
					$Choice{
					Yes.|

						Rodnin: I see. I wonder why you came all this way then?
						Lore: I was curious.
						Rodnin: I understand. Still, your mother was an excellent woman. It would have been good to have you. Even if you don't work here, you're always welcome in the office. If you have any questions about me or your mother, or anything at all, I'll be here. Please let me know if you need anything.

		Rodnin: What can I do for you?
		$Choice{
		Tell me about yourself.|
			Rodnin: Well, as you know, I specialize in environmental science. I studied at the university of course, then worked with your mother in the lab down the street. We did mostly genetic engineering. It's amazing how similar microbiology is to the macrobiology I do work in. It's as if each cell is its own ecosystem...Ah, I'm going off on a tangent. By the way, how are you doing?
			$Choice{
				I'm doing well.|
					Rodnin: I'm glad to hear it. Have you had any headaches recently?
					$Choice{
						Be honest.|
							Lore: Yes, actually. I've been getting them more and more recently.
							Rodnin: Ah, well. I've heard something's going around...Listen, I know it sounds a bit weird, but please let me know if anything out of the ordinary happens. Saftey and all that, yes?
						|Lie.|
							Lore: No, I haven't.

							Something in Rodnin's eyes made Lore think he seemed disappointed.

							Rodnin: Is that so? I'm glad to hear it.
							}
				|Not so good.|
					Rodnin: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Headaches?
					Be honest.|
							Lore: Yes, actually. I've been getting them more and more recently.
							Rodnin: Ah, well. I've heard something's going around...Listen, I know it sounds a bit weird, but please let me know if anything out of the ordinary happens. Saftey and all that, yes?
						|Lie.|
							Lore: No, I haven't gotten any headaches.

							Rodnin: Is that so? I'm glad to hear it.|

		|Tell me about the work you did with my mother.|
			Rodnin: Oh, it was mostly genetic engineering. Being an environmental scientist, I was a bit lost the whole time.

			Rodnin chuckled a little.

			Rodnin: Not your mother, though, no. She was amazing. Fast worker, always on schedule. She was one of those scientists that never lost their imagination in school. She was always saying she had a dream, or rather a vision of the future. She said it was a secret and she'd tell me when the time came, but...She got sick before she could ever tell me. If you ask me, I think her secret vision was you. Your mother really loved you. She believed in you, that you would do everything she couldn't or didn't have time for. Well, I suppose you already know all this. You lived with her, after all.
		|Tell me about the Wilderness.|
			Rodnin leaned in closer, his eyes sparkling.

			Rodnin: It's unbelievable. You get so tired of seeing the same scenery every day in the city. The Wilderness is vast, incredibly vast, and every day is different. You live from day to day, your only objective is to survive and learn. No sign of human impact for kilometers. You get a deep appreciation for both human and animal life. Ah...

			He became lost in thought for a moment.

			Rodnin: I'd love to go back, but I have my duties here. I've been in the field for long enough.
			Lore: I want to go.

			Rodnin seemed shocked.

			Rodnin: You want to go? *laughs* Well, I'll be damned. I knew you had your mother's spirit.
			Lore: How did you get there?
			Rodnin: Oh, by plane.
			Lore: Plane? But, aircrafts-
			Rodnin: Yes, yes, rocketry is a recent invention. Only a few people in the world have planes. I happen to be one of those people. *laughs* Don't look so impressed.
			$set_beglearnedplane_1
			$if_stoleplaneguide_eq_1{
			Lore: (So he has a plane, and that's what these blueprints are for. He must have the plane stored somewhere closeby. If I follow him after he leaves the office, maybe I can find the plane and take it myself.
				$Choice{
				Wait outside the office until nightfall|
					Lore exited the building and waited, hidden, in the @blue{Business District}. After a while, @green{Rodnin} came out of the office, followed by the secretary and lift attendant. @green{Rodnin} waved goodbye and headed in the direction of the @blue{Industrial District}.
					$set_followRodnin_eq_1
				|There's a better way|
				Lore: There's no need for me to steal just to get to the Wilderness. I should find another way.|})
			}
		|Nevermind.|
		$if_analyzedata_eq_1{ |I've analyzed the data.
			Rodnin: That was fast. I knew you were a brilliant scientist from the moment I met you. So, what did you find out?
			Lore: The rocks are breaking down quickly. It looks like the sinkhole is true.
			
			Rodnin didn't seem surprised.
			
			Rodnin: Yes, I figured as much. There were tremors almost every day when I was in the field.
			Lore: I'd like to go to the Wildnerness to study this more.
			Rodnin: Would you? Oh, I see. You need the plane to get there. Well, Lore, you've analyzed one piece of data for me. Why would I trust you with one of the most valuable pieces of technology in the world?
			Lore: But my mother-
			Rodnin: Yes, your mother. I would trust your mother with the plane. But I don't know you. Prove your worth. Once I see your passion for this research, then we can talk about the plane.|
