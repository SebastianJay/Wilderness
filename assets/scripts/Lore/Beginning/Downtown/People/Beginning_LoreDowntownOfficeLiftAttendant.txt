	Lift Attendant: What floor, ma'am?
	Lore: Second, please.
	Lift Attendant: Certainly.

	Lift Attendant: Meeting with Rodnin?
	$Choice{
		That's right|
			Lift Attendant: Well, don't be nervous. Rodnin's a nice guy, he is, good employer. Why, last time I was sick he gave me the whole week off to recover and even sent me a card. 
			Lore: Thanks. I'll try not to be nervous.
			
			The elevator came to a stop and the door opened.
			
			Lift Attendant: Here you are, miss.
			Lore: Thank you.
			
			Lore stepped out of the @blue{elevator}. Down the hall was @blue{Rodnin's office}.
		|That's none of your business|
			Lift Attendant: I s'pose you're right, miss. Please forgive me.
			
			The two remained silent until the elevator came to a stop and the door opened.
			
			Lift Attendant: Here you are, miss.
			
			Lore stepped out of the @blue{elevator}. Down the hall was @blue{Rodnin's office}.|
