		Lore: Lore.

		The secretary's eyes widened.

		Secretary: One moment, please.

		The secretary picked up the phone at the desk and dialed a number.

		Secretary: Yes, Mr. Rodnin? Sorry to interrupt. No, nothing's wrong, but...A woman named Lore has come to interview with you. Yes, sir...Yes, I'll send her up.

		He put the phone down and turned back to Lore.

		Secretary: Mr. Rodnin will see you now.
		Lore: Oh, um, thank you.
		Secretary: Take the @blue{elevator} up to the second floor and his office is straight down the hall to the left.
