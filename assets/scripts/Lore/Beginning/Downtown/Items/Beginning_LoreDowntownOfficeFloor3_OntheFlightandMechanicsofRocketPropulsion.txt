            Lore: If I have the blueprints, I can figure out how to fly the plane. I won't need to rely on anyone else or take them from their busy lives. Maybe if I follow Rodnin after he leaves the office tonight, I'll learn where the plane is. Then, I can take it and finally get to the Wildnerness.

                Lore exited the building and waited, hidden, in the @blue{Business District}. After a while, @green{Rodnin} came out of the office, followed by the secretary and lift attendant. @green{Rodnin} waved goodbye and headed in the direction of the @blue{Industrial District}.

            Lore: Plane blueprints? I wonder why? I should talk to Rodnin, maybe he's hiding something.

    |Put it back|
        Lore put the book back on the shelf.
