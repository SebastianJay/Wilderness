	Lore began to analyze the data samples. Time seemed to stop as she busily logged the details of the soil into the heavy book. 
		Think{This is bad. The percentage of soluble rocks is exponentially decreasing with time. If the rock continues to break down at this rate...It will be disastrous. What can I do? This has to be stopped.
		$choice{
		Find out why the rocks are breaking down|
			I need to know why the rocks are breaking down like this. I need to go to the Wilderness. Going alone will be difficult. I should talk to my friends first and tell them about this data. They might know what to do.

			$set_Halnumber_2
		|Tell Rodnin about the data|
			I should report this to Rodnin. Maybe he has some kind of explanation.
			$set_analyzedata_1
			$set_Halnumber_2
		|Ask Hal|
			Hal worked for Rodnin in the past. He studied this data too, he must have seen the same pattern. Maybe he knows why this is happening.
			$set_analyzedata_1
			$set_Halnumber_2
		|I don't know|
			I don't know what to do. I need help with this. I should ask my friends, or Rodnin, or Hal...Or maybe I should do this alone. They all have lives to get back to. Mine is over. I need to go to the Wilderness.

        The data samples were locked in the cabinet. There was no way to get them out.
