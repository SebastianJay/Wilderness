go to{
	Lore walked down the hall and stopped at the door of Rodnin's office.
}

look around{
	The door to the office was slightly ajar. Through the crack Lore could see @green{Rodnin} slouched over his desk. 
	The office seemed cluttered, but the stacks of paper and lab equipment made it seem less intimidating. She could always return to the @blue{elevator} when the time comes.
