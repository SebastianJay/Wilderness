	Rune: Hi, Lore! What's up?

		I need your help|
			Lore: I took the job that you guys recommended.
			Rune: Really? That's so great! We're all so proud of you.
			Lore: Thanks. But I'm having trouble understanding this data I'm analyzing. They're soil samples from the Wilderness. From what I can tell, the soluble rock composition is far less than it should be, and the rocks are porous and cracked in an unusual weathering pattern. I can't figure out what could have caused the erosion.
			$if_loreMorality_gt_-3{
				Rune: Hm. I don't think I can help you unless I can analyze the soil myself. Do you have it with you?
				Lore: No, it's still in the lab.
				Rune: I guess you'll have to get it, then. I'll be here when you get back.
				Lore: You're going to make me go all the way back to the lab just so you can analyze the soil?
				Rune: Hey, you're the one who asked for my help.
				Lore: Fine, I'll be back.

				Rune: I'd like to help, Lore, but I can't. 
				Lore: What? Why not?
				Rune: You're in a bad place right now. Don't lie, I know. And that's okay. But what's important for you is to get back on your feet. You can't keep bullying other people. I'm not doing your work for you. I know you can figure it out yourself.
				Lore: Fine, I didn't want your help anyway.
				Rune: Lore-
				Lore: Don't.

		|Just checking in|
			Lore: I'm just checking in to see how you're doing.
			Rune: Aw, that's sweet of you. To tell the truth, I could be better. My parents won't let up about me joining the goverment as a chemist. They're relying on me to have a high income so that I can support them, since the shop's not doing too well. But I don't really want to work for the government. I want to teach, here, at the university. Oh my, I shouldn't rant so much to you. It's not like there's anything you can do about it.
			$Choice{
			It's okay|
				Lore: I'm happy to listen to you rant. We're friends, remember?
				Rune: Right, thanks. You're the best!
				$inc_Loremorality_1
			|Shut up|
				Lore: Yeah, there's nothing I can do. I don't know why you're even bothering to tell me. You don't know what it's like to be unhappy. Not like I do.
				Rune: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
				Lore: Shut up.
				
				Rune fell silent, her eyes watering.

		|Pat her on the head|
			Lore pat Rune on the head.
			Rune blinked in confusion at her, then laughed at the awkward silence.
			Rune patted Lore on the head in return and went back to her work.
		|Nevermind|
			Rune: See you around!|

		Lore: I've brought the samples.
		Rune: Yay, thanks!
		
		Lore handed the data samples over to Rune. Rune carried them over to a microscope and powered it up.
		
		Rune: Mind if I take a bit for the slide?
		
		She didn't wait for an answer and made a wet slide of the soil. She slid it under the microscope and adjused the knobs with well-trained precision.
		
		Rune: Mmhm...Huh. That's weird.
		Lore: What is it?
		Rune: Hold on, hold on. 
		
		She stood up from the microscope and took another pinch of the soil and placed it in a beaker.
		
		Lore: Are you going to take all of my soil?
		
		Rune ignored her. She grabbed some kind of chemical from under the hood on the other side of the room. Taking a pipette, she placed a few drops in the soil. The mixture bubbled up immediately.
		
		Rune: Ooh.
		Lore: What is it?
		Rune: Hm. 
		
		Rune filtered out the solid from the liquid left in the beaker and grabbed more chemicals. Lore tapped her foot impatiently.
		
		Lore: Are you going to ignore me this whole time?
		Rune: Huh? Did you say something?
		Lore: Very funny.
		
		Rune mixed a few more chemicals and then thrust the beaker in front of Lore.
		
		Rune: Look! A precipitate!
		Lore: Cool. Did you have fun?
		Rune: I said look. It's salt. You see, the soil underwent a reaction that-
		Lore: Just tell me the important things.
		Rune: You know, chemistry is important. It wouldn't hurt you to learn every now and then. Anyways, there's a manmade chemical in the soil.
		Lore: Manmade? Could it have been from the researchers?
		Rune: Not unless they were trying to destroy the sample.
		Lore: What do you mean?
		Rune: There was a highly potent acid present. Didn't you think it was weird that there was no vegetation on the soil?
		Lore: It occurred to me.
		Rune: Someone intentionally killed this land. That's why the holes and cracks in the rocks looked weird to you. They aren't from water, they're from acid.
		Lore: Why would someone do that?
		Rune: I don't know. Did all the samples show the same erosion?
		
		Lore nodded. Rune cast her eyes down in concern.
		
		Lore: Listen, Rune. I want to go to the Wilderness to study this more.
		Rune: What?
		Lore: I know it sounds crazy, but I feel like this is something I'm meant to do.
		Rune: Well you're not going alone. 
		Lore: Excuse me?
		Rune: I'm going with you. I'm done with classes for the season anyway, and now you've made me curious.
		Lore: No, no, I don't want you to get involved.
		Rune: Then why did you ask for my help?
		
		Lore had no answer.
		
		Rune: Got you there, didn't I?
		
		She laughed.
		
		Rune: I know Quen and Essa will want to help too. When you've talked to everyone, where should I meet you?
		Lore: At Rodnin's office, in the Business District.
		Rune: Will do. Oh, this is so exciting! 
		
		Rune jumped up and embraced Lore.
		
		Rune: Okay, I'm going to swing home and let my parents know what I'm doing. Talk to Quen and Essa, and then we'll meet at the office. Bye!
		
		Rune pranced out of the engineering department.
