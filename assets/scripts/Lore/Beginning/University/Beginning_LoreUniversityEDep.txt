	Lore walked over to the engineering department. The sound of machines and radios echoed through the halls. A pathway went through the facilities and headed up to the @blue{Aquatic and Fitness Center}. She'd have to go through there to get to the dining hall. She could also go to the @blue{Science Department}, @blue{Math Department}, or @blue{Department of Others}. She wondered if she would run into her old professor, @green{Mark Sherriff}.
