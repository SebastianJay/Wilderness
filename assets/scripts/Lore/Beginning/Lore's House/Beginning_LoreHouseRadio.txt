#Beginning_LoreHouseRadio
#Lore wakes up at her house to start her side of the game

go to{
	A radio was going off in the @blue{house}. Lore's eyes batted open, the haze of sleep still clouding her 
	mind.

listen{
	@italic{The voice on the radio spoke in a monotonous, lifeless tone.} Recent protests concerning the 
	alleged sinkhole have continued to break out across the city, but government officials are urging 
	citizens to stay calm. Leading experts in the field say there is no strong evidence that a sinkhole is
	forming, and advise people to be skeptical.

			place in case of emergency. The government always puts the safety and best interest of the people
			first. He asks citizens to avoid panic and protest, and reminds them that all citizens can do their part

look around{
	Lore gave her room a thorough look. She had lived here for years, but the place felt foreign to her.
	Other than the bed, there was a small desk and @yellow{dresser}. The door to the @blue{bathroom}
	was slightly ajar, draping a long shadow over the floor. Across the room, the @blue{hallway} door 
	was being attacked by Lore's cat, @green{Marthi}. She was probably hungry.
