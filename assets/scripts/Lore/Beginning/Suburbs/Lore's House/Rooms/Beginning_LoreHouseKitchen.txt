look around{
	The counter was messy. @yellow{Papers}, @yellow{junk mail}, and dishes were strewn about lazily. A few @yellow{pill bottles} sat next to the sink. Marthi's @yellow{cat food} was leaning against the foot of the counter. Opposite the kitchen was the @blue{living room}, although it was such a small space it could hardly be considered a room.
