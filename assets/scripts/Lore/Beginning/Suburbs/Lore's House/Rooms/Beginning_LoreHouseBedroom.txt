		A radio was going off in the @blue{house}. Lore's eyes batted open, the haze of sleep still clouding her mind.

		Voice: @italic{(In monotone)} Recent protests concerning the alleged sinkhole have continued to break out across the city, but government officials are urging citizens to stay calm. Leading experts in the field say there is no strong evidence that a sinkhole is forming, and advise people to be skeptical.

				Voice: Officer Ellion would like to remind everyone that the government has plans in place in case of emergency. The government always puts the safety and best interest of the people first. He asks citizens to avoid panic and protest, and reminds them that all citizens can do their part by reporting those they witness or suspect of conspiracy... @italic{(fades to static)}

		Lore entered the bedroom. Her twin @yellow{bed} was always a welcome space to take a load off.

		Lore gave her room a thorough look. She had lived here for years, but the place felt foreign to her. Other than the @yellow{bed}, there was a small desk and @yellow{dresser}. The door to the @blue{bathroom} was slightly ajar, draping a long shadow over the floor. Across the room, the @blue{hallway} door was being attacked by Lore's cat, @green{Marthi}. She was probably hungry.

		Lore gave her room a thorough look. The radio alarm was perched on top of a desk next to her @yellow{bed}. A @yellow{dresser} was flush with the wall. The @blue{bathroom} was attached to one side of the room, and the door to the @blue{hallway} on the other.
