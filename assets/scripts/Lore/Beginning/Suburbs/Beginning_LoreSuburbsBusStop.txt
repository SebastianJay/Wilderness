#Beginning_LoreSuburbsBusStop

goto{
	Lore walked to the bus stop and took a seat on the bench. 
}

inspect{
	Lore glanced at the routes and timetables. From this stop, she could go to the @blue{university} or the @blue{downtown}. 
}

think{
	Lore: It feels weird going back to the university. Ever since I left, I feel so distant from it. Like it's in a different world. I don't know if it makes me nervous or excited. I don't really know much of how I feel anymore. Every day is just like the last.

	$if_thoughtBusStopBeg_1
	Lore: I should see when the bus is coming.
