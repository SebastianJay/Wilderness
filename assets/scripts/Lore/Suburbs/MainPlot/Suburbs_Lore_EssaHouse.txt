		Lore knocked on the door. It was answered by Essa's little sister, Nillie.
		
		Nillie: Uh, hello?
		Lore: Hi, I'm Essa's friend, Lore.
		Nillie: Hi, Lore.
		Lore: Can I talk to you for a second?
		
		Nillie's mother appeared behind her. She was wrapped in a house robe, her hair unkempt.
		
		Mother: Nillie, who are you talking to?
		Lore: Hi, I'm Essa's friend, Lore.
		Mother: Essa's not home.
		Lore: Oh, I know, I actually came to talk to you and your family. 
		Mother: Why? Is Essa okay? Oh god...
		Lore: Essa's fine! She's great, actually! May I speak to Nillie alone?
		Mother: Absolutely not.
		Lore: But-
		Mother: Anything you have to say to my daughter, you can say in front of me.
		Lore: *sigh* Okay. You see, Essa wants to come with me to the Wilderness to do research.
		Mother: My lord! What have you put into my daughter's head? What are you trying to do to my family!? You're ruining everything! You can't take my Essa away!
		
		She began sobbing. Nillie, confused, also began to cry. Footsteps behind them made them bolt to the sides of the door. Nillie's father swaggered up, eyes bloodshot.
		
		Father: What's going on over here? Why all the yapping?
		
		Lore swallowed a lump in her throat.

			Essa and I want to do research in the Wilderness|
				Lore: Essa and I want to do research in the Wilderness. It's important, and it may save-
				Father: Essa...That little punk. She wants to leave? After everything I've done for her? Turn her back on her family, just like that?
				Lore: It's not like that, Essa's trying to save you by stopping the sinkhole.
				Father: The sinkhole, eh? That's a load of you know what.
				
				He spat.
				
				Father: If she wants to leave us, fine. But you tell her that if she comes back, I'll make her pay for what she did. I'll kill her. Y'hear? 
				
				He shoved Nillie out the door. Lore caught her in her arms.
				
				Father: You want Nillie, too, huh? Well good riddance. 
				Mother: No, please-
				Father: Shut up! If I catch another word of your whining I'll cut your tongue out. 
				
				He grabbed his wife by the arm and slammed the door in Lore and Nillie's face. The little girl was still crying.
				
				Lore: Hey, Nillie, it's okay, I'll take you somewhere safe.
				
				Nillie looked up at Lore, eyes full of tears.
				
				Nillie: But you're taking my sister away? I'm never going to see her again.
				Lore: No, no, we're only going away for a little while. We'll be back, don't worry. Essa will come and live with you and take care of you as soon as we get back.
				
				Nillie didn't respond, but she was no longer crying. Lore needed to take her to @blue{Hal's house}.

			|I'm taking Nillie to a safe home|
				Lore: I'm taking Nillie with me to a safe place.
				
				Nillie's father leaned close to Lore and stared into her eyes. Lore could feel his stale breath hit her face.
				
				Father: That so? There's no safer place than here for her. We're her family. And who are you? Some stranger.
				Lore: Nillie deserves better than this. I'm taking her. 
				
				Nillie's father looked smugly down at his daughter.
				
				Father: Nillie, what do you say? Do you want to go with some stranger, or your family that's loved you since you were born?
				
				Nillie closed her eyes in fear. After a moment, she stepped outside the door and grabbed Lore's hand.
				
				Father: Why you-
				
				Nillie's mother screamed. Without thinking, Lore hoisted Nillie into her arms and bolted down the road towards @blue{Hal's house}.
