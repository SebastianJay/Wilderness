#This is the place that connects the suburbs to the university and downtown. This is the only way to reach the suburbs from those places as well.
go to{
	Lore reached the simple @blue{bus stop}.
}
look around{
	A simple bus stop with a bench and a faded blue sign. The bus went to the @blue{University} or @blue{downtown}. The bus stop was pretty empty.
}

think{
	Lore: It feels weird going back to the university. Ever since I left, I feel so distant from it. Like it's in a different world. I don't know if it makes me nervous or excited. I don't really know much of how I feel anymore. Every day is just like the last.
	$if_thoughtBusStopBeg_eq_1{
		Lore: I should see when the bus is coming.

	$set_thoughtBusStopBeg_1
}

wait{
	Lore waited until a bus came to pick her up. She filed into the back and pressed her head against the glass.
