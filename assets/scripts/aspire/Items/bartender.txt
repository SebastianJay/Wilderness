		Bartender: Look this is how we order drinks here in Aspire:
		1. Find a @yellow{bottle token}. These are normally distributed as currency from the bank, but since the Chikasi Clan is holding up
		businesss over there, the chance of getting one now is impossible.
		2. @red{Use} the token @red{on} the vending machine over there in the corner.
		3. Press the button of the drink you want and a @yellow{ticket} will dispense.
		4. @red{Talk to} @green{me} again when you have that ticket and I'll hand you a drink.

		#Kipp now has the ticket.

		The bartender looked closely at the ticket, and threw it behind him. He then left to go to the stock room in the back.
		The bartender came back wearing a raditation mask and holding a red glowing drink.
