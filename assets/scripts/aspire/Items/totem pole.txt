			Kipp took a step forward, nervously holding the tomahawk in his hand.

			Kipp: Alright, shoot how many did he say? Right, 31. I hope he ain't pulling anything on me and he meant 31 like the age old Lassie was before she kicked the bucket, and I mean the first time she kicked the bucket while I was trying to milk her, or was that 10? Like I remember how old our cow was. I swore never to visit that pen again after... right, 31 markings. Here we go.

				Kipp worked anxiously as if a Kala and Ma-Zoo were breathing down his neck. Actually, they were. They laughed at Kipp every time he messed up the marking. Kipp would try to fix it the best he can.

				Kipp: Almost done. Maybe one more?

				Kipp was debating whether to add a 26th marking once he finished this one. He pressed too hard into the totem pole and the blade snapped off the handle. It dug into the pole and all Kipp had in his hand was the handle.

				Kipp: Oh no. No, no, no, no, no... This can't be happening.

				Kipp stepped back to try look away from what he done.

				Akecheta: I can't...believe it.
				Kipp: I know. I know. I can get another tomahawk and...
				Akecheta: ...and what? This is perfect.
				Kipp: I understand, but...wait what?
				Akecheta: You have passed the test. I shall listen with an open mind from now on, brother.
				Kipp: Well thank you.

				Kipp took a heavy sigh of relief.

				Kipp: What I was trying to say... is that don't your morals matter more than someone elses'? I understand that Rowen has added notoriety to your clan, and now you are in a temporary position of power, but is stealing from the innocent people's livelihood worth any power.
				Kala: We are criminals! This is our job! Akecheta give me the word and I'll squash this little piece of...
				Akecheta: No, he is right.
				Kala: You know what, Akecheta? Ever since we put you as leader, all you've done is ruin the reputation of the Chikasi Clan.
				Akecheta: @bold{My father did not raise a bunch of savages.} Do you want to return home and be remembered as the group of people who stooped so low that they decided to pilage for entertainment? Who disrespected the entire ancestory in one generation!

				The room went silent.Akecheta resumed.

				Akecheta: I can tolerate if we fight for the name of our people, but I will not put up with blindly giving into sending this world into the afterlife for what we have done.

				Suddenly Akecheta fell forward, groaning in pain. The green glow from his eyes intensified until, a tiny little being escaped from his left ear. The Chikasi Clan went in an uproar, declaring that the parasite was poisoning their lead this whole time. An array of bullets were aimed at the being as it jumped straight out the door. The clan pursued, leaving Akecheta and Kipp behind.

				Kipp: Akecheta?
				Akecheta: Thank you. Our clan's values are now safe for the next generation of our kind. I am in your debt.
				Kipp: Great. Well, you know Rowen and what's been going on, right?
				Akecheta: Say no more, the Chikasi Clan will assemble, but we can't do this on our own. You need to @yellow{convince the other two clans so that we can fight as one}. Rowen may be alone, but he still has that parasite in his brain, and we don't know what he can do with that intelligence.
				Kipp: Already ahead of ya. One more thing, how did that thing get into your head in the first place?
				Akecheta: I don't know but it was briefly after that thing they called "the wilderness" opened up. We were heading towards the West when I woke up one day with the most ingrained pain in my head. I couldn't think. I could only act, and if I disobeyed whatever replaced my thoughts, then I would start to feel something eating away at my brain. Whatever it is, be careful Kipp.
				Kipp: Will do.

				Kipp took his time, widdling all day since he had nothing better to do than to focus on the one thing that could prematurely end his life.

				On his last mark, Kipp put the last craving in has if he was just finishing off a masterpiece. Kipp stood back to get a better look.

				Kipp: Vew-wa-la! it is complete.

				Everyone murmured between each other, trying to hide their expressions from Kipp.

				Akecheta: I can't believe this.
				Kipp: Believe what?
				Akecheta: KALA! MA-ZOO! DISPOSE OF THIS TRAITOR!
				Kipp: Wait! Wha...
