		Flint: Hey, we get it. We ain't going to cause no more trouble for you. Just make sure you have those other two gangs in check.

		Kipp: Alright, I got my revolver.
		Flint: Well looky here. Someone brought a really fancy shooter to the party. Now let's see what you've got. See the @yellow{line of bottles} on the wall. All I want you to do is shoot of 33 bottles off that wall, and I'll know whether or not you've got the street knowledge of the Smoking Gun. Get it right and you're in "Ding! Ding!". Get it wrong, and I'll have these fellas over here test out their pistols to "make sure they're working".
		#33 in base 4 is 15 in base 10
		
		The group began smiling at Kipp.
		
		Kipp: @italic{(Looking straight into Flint's eyes)}Bring it on.
		Flint: That's the spirit. Now, just @red{use} you @yellow{revolver} on the @red{line of bottles} when yer ready. Just don't screw up.
		
		Flint went back to the table laughing to himself. The others members at the table joined in.
