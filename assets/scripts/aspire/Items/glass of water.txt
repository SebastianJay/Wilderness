			Kipp slowly walked around the store to not cause suspicion. Once he passed by the glass of water, he poured a little bit of the potion into the glass. He started whistling when the Rune Raider approached and walked away. The Raider stared at Kipp and went back to his water. He took a sip to clear his throat.

			Just then his face turned red. He tried covering his mouth, but it was no use. A burst of flame shot up into the ceiling and his breath was being doused in heat. He was screaming for relief.

			Kipp tried to stay as quiet as possible. The scene caught Mohani's attention and she left her post for a second. Kipp rummaged around to find some clue about numbers. Kipp did find a bullet with some marking on it. By the time he picked up the bullet, Mohani had already casted a spell on the Raider to extinguish the fire by freezing him into a block of ice.

			Mohani: That should do. He should thaw out in about an hour. Someone keep watch of him.

			Kipp had no time. He snagged the bullet and put it in his pocket before leaving the purse back the way it was. @bold{*Mohani's Bullets Added to Inventory*}
