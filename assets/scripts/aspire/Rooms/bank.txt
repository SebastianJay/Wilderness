			Kipp made his way over to the bank, turning his head frequently to make sure Rowen wasn't around to start another commotion.
			Expecting the worst, Kipp slowy pushed against the door, hoping that no one will notice him walk in.

			Kipp: @italic{(to himself)} I guess they're all too busy with something else.

			Looking around, Kipp noticed everyone on the ground with their heads down and trembling in fear.
			Kipp looked over the counter to see a woman dressed in some kind of traditional outfit. 
			She seems to be holding a shotgun to the teller by the safe.

				Kipp: @italic{(in a loud tone)} Hey, you should wat...
				
				The Gang Member sneered at Kipp and hit him with the butt of her shotgun.
				Kipp grunted and fell back, landing on the wooden panels.
				
				Kipp: @italic{(grieving)} Yup, Lucy was right. A girl @italic{will} eventually knock me out one day. 
				I just wish she didn't mean it like this.

			Kipp looked to see a man leaning against the bank's vault. He had light brown skin with a slight orange tint around his face.
			He wore dark pants, a white shirt, and a jean jacket. His hair was grown out and always kept a stern expression.
			Everything fit into place, except for the fact that his clothes were covered in dirt and that his eyes glowed the same shade as Rowen's. 
			
			Akecheta: Salutations, I am Akecheta. I am the leader of this tribe, the Chikasi Clan. Sorry for my appearance. I had a disagreement
			with the group down at the gunsmith shop. We are not the type of people who enjoy inflicting pain upon others.

			Akecheta stopped for a second and took in a deep breathe as if he was going sigh. He opened his eyes to continue.

			Akecheta: Yes, I understand the hipocrisy in my words. You see, we try to live with peace among others and spite only those who won't return
			the same respect we give, but the person who currently pulls all of the strings around this town tells us that we are weak and will dissolve 
			within the competition between the other two clans if we hold back.

			Kipp: You don't look like the type that would lead such a dangerous group of criminals.
			
			Kipp noticed his last statement and began shielding his body.

			Kipp: So you're still assisting in this orchestra of violence. Akecheta, do understand that you don't have to follow Rowen's code.
			Akecheta: But look at how much Rowen has bestowed upon us for following him.
			
			The leader's eyes began glowing brighter.
			
			Akecheta: He has shown more respect to us than anyone ever has. Those who defy him are ingorant of his actions.
			Kipp: I'm not sure you understand the whole...
			Akecheta: Silence! Outsiders only spread lies and disband us. Leave where you are not welcome!
			
			Kipp stopped to rephrase.

			Kipp: @italic{(Calmly)} Okay. If I prove to you that I am a member of this group and that I am only here to reason with you, then can we
			keep an open mind about all of this?
			
			Akecheta: It will be hard to prove that you have the knowledge of the Chikasi Clan, but if you are willing to prove yourself, then
			I see no reason to reject you offer. I will give you one mission and if you can complete it, then I will retract my accusation of
			the reason for your presence.
