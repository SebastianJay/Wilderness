		#This is what will display when Kipp runs away from Rowen and visits the library for the first time. Kipp and Arthur scurried to the library. Once Arthur burst opens the doors. He begins running around with joy. Kipp noticed several families hiding in every corner of the library. They must have been kicked out of their own homes.

		Arthur: Welcome to Aspire! We don't get that many visitors here since the incident.
		Kipp: Excuse me, the what?
		Arthur: @italic{(Now Confused)} Wait, you don't know?

		Arthur stopped suddenly, ran to grab a seat, and plopped it down in front of Kipp.

		Arthur: I reckon you came from the town due east, right?
		Kipp: @italic{(Nodding)} Yeah, I'm Kipp.
		Arthur: @italic{(Serious)} Well, when your hometown became too crowded to raise a farm or business for every family, people have been venturing out to lands far north to find new opportunities. The town of Aspire was built to help these so called pioneers. Our economy thrives on providing people with the necessary supplies in order to travel for days on unknown territory. We were considered the center of everything. The three hordes that are keeping us hostage, they came here one day in an organized manner and took out our businesses one by one. We were surprised 'cause them three bashful brute crews were sworn enemies since we last knew. Once that smart fellow, Rowen, showed up, I think his smartness spread to those hordes and now every criminal turned into a mastermind with their signature green glowing eyes. Funny, too, 'cause I don't remember Rowen ever being a part of any of those groups. But now, they have been ordering us around and horded the profits for themselves. They weren't hesitant to resort to violence to keep up in line. Sooner or later, our money supply is gonna run dry. Then we'll be saying goodbye to our town. You gotta help us, Kipp. There no time left for waiting.
		Kipp: But I can't stand toe to toe with the three most dangerous gangs in all of existence!
		Arthur: But you gotta try! Here, if it helps, the hordes may have gotten smarter, but they still have grounded cattle meat between one another.
		Kipp: You mean beef?
		Arthur: Yeah! Anyway, I think if you can influence them somehow, then they may trust you and work together to coup that no good stinken Rowen. Rowen doesn't care about the hordes problems. He only cares about the power.
		Kipp: Alright, I'll trust you on that.
		Arthur: Great, take this. @bold{*Random Token Added to Inventory*}

		Arthur: It was my daddy's. It fell out of his pocket before those no good outlaws hauled him off to jail.

		Arthur began to get sad and sighed. Kipp smiled and began rubbing the top of Arthur's head.

		Kipp: Don't worry. Everything will be alright.

		Kipp walked to the door.

		Arthur: Wait! One more thing, it's super important. @yellow{The numbers those gang members are using don't seem to work like ours.} I tried to buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, so I gave him two quarters and he told me they only accept exact change. I was standing there all confused. They either must be pretty smart, or they are in on something that we are not. Maybe something on the @yellow{bookshelf} will help later on, but I think you are smart enough to handle it.

		Kipp took Arthur's advice and nodded. He headed back to the door.

		Kipp: Now, where would I be able to find those cliques hideouts. Last time I remember, I saw a group of people crowed next door in the @blue{bank}. On the other side of town, I also saw two big businesses still open: the @blue{saloon} and the @blue{gunsmith shop}. I would have to @red{go to} @blue{town center} first before I can reach those places across town first, but if I keep calm then maybe Rowen and his group won't notice me.

		#Text when Kipp returns to this room
		Kipp: So this is where they hold all the knowledge gathered from far and wide. I wonder where I should start. Maybe if I @red{look around}... I could also @red{go to} the @blue{bank} or @blue{town center} from here.

look around{
	Kipp stepped back to take a good look at the room. He eyed a fancy @yellow{bookshelf} with some books that may be worth @red{inspecting}. In the far left corner of the room, Kipp also saw a @yellow{sleeping bag}. It may not be the right time to take a nap, but maybe he could @red{use} it to de-stress for a while. He looked back at @green{Arthur}. It looked like he hasn't gotten any better since we last talked. Maybe Kipp should go @red{talk to} @green{Arthur} again.

	Kipp: Hmm...what should I do?

    Kipp woke up.
    
    Arthur: You okay big buddy?
    Kipp: Don't worry about me, Arthur. I'll be fine.
    Arthur: Good.
    Kipp: And I'll make sure your dad will come home.
    Arthur: Yay!
