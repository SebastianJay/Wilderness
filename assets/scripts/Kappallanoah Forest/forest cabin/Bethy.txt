        Kipp: We're new to this place. Can you tell us what's around here?
        Bethy: Of course!
        So the @blue{forest cabin} is right next to this @blue{abandoned treehouse}. Be careful wandering near that place. The @blue{lumber mill} and the @blue{hunting range} are located south of here. Finally, the exit to this forest can be located at the @blue{hunting range}. People say there use to be a fourth location here: some sort of cave. The tourist attraction was torn down due it rumors about safety issues. Hope this helped.
        Kipp: Thank you mam.
        Bethy: Anytime dear.
