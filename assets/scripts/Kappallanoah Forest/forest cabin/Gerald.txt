			Kipp: Alright. Then tell me @bold{everything} you know about this forest, especially what happened recently.
			Gerald: Yes, sir! I'll tell everything! The camping area consists of 10 cabins, including this one. There is a @blue{hunting range} and a @blue{lumber mill} down south. There's a mysterious cave about 1 hour from here...
			Kipp: Anything notable happened to the forest in these few years?
			Gerald: No. It's always like this. I promise!
			Kipp: Ok. I'll let you off this time.

			Gerald: Oh, o-okay. Sure, I come here every year. It's a pretty nice place. In my opinion, of course. I'm not sure though, I haven't been to many forests... *rambles on*
			Kipp: *sigh* I've heard that there was a fire a few years back that destroyed the entire area. Is it true?
			Gerald: A fire? No, I don't think so. I might be wrong, though. It's not like I'm here all the time... *rambles on*
			Kipp: Ok. Thank you.
