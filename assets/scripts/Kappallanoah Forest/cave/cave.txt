                [companionName]: Alright, Kipp. Make sure you have that rifle ready for anything that comes running towards us. And when we reach a junction, use that magic coin flipping trick like they taught you.
                Kipp: Gotcha.
                
                Kipp and [companionName] cautiously stepped forward. A large growl came from inside the cave.
                
                [companionName]: You first.
                Kipp: Why not you.
                [companionName]: @bold{Because you have the rifle!}
                
                Another roar interrupted their argument. The roars grew louder and louder. 
                
                Kipp: Let's just back out now.
                [companionName]: I second that.
                
                The last roar then began stuttering on a broken loop.
                
                Kipp: Wait. I don't think any beast sounds like that.
                
                Kipp and [companionName] walked into the cave and investigated.
                
                [companionName]: It's just a record player on loop.
                Kipp: So why would someone do this?
                [companionName]: Kipp, over here. There are cave drawings.
                
                The wall was covered with paintings of a person going around the world and saving the world. In the center, there was a drawing of a guy with the word "Kipp" by him.
                
                Kipp: Is this some strange prophecy or something?
                [companionName]: I don't think any of this is real.
                
                Creepy Man: But it is all true! HA HA HA HA HA!
                
                The man raised his hands and the cave starting crumbling around him.
                
                Kipp and [companionName]: RUN!

            }

        }$else{
            [companionName]: Kipp we really can't be here. We're gonna have to come back when we have some way of defending ourselves.
            
            Kipp and [compainonName] walked back to the hunting range.
            
            Kipp: Well now what should we do?
            $goto_huntingRange
        }
    }$else{
        [companionName]: Kipp. I'm not going in there until we know what could lie in that cave.
