            [companionName]: Alright, Kipp. Make sure you have that rifle ready for anything that comes running towards us.
            Kipp: Gotcha.
            
            Kipp and [companionName] cautiously stepped forward. A large growl came from inside the cave.
            
            [companionName]: You first.
            Kipp: Why not you.
            [companionName]: @bold{Because you have the rifle!}
            
            Another roar interrupted their argument. The roars grew louder and louder. 
            
            Kipp: Let's just back out now.
            [companionName]: I second that.
            
            The last roar then began stuttering on a broken loop.
            
            Kipp: Wait. I don't think any beast sounds like that.
            
            Kipp and [companionName] walked into the cave and investigated.
            
            [companionName]: It's just a record player on loop.
            Kipp: So why would someone do this?
            [companionName]: Kipp, over here. There are cave drawings.
            
            The wall was covered with paintings of a person going around the world and saving the world. In the center, there was a drawing of a guy with the word "Kipp" by him.
            
            Kipp: Is this some strange prophecy or something?
            [compaionName]: I don't think any of this is real.
            
            Creepy Man: But it is all true! HA HA HA HA HA!
            
            The man raised his hands and the cave starting crumbling around him.
            
            Kipp and [companionName]: RUN!
            
            @bold_orange{KAPPALLANOAH FOREST LEVEL COMPLETE!}
        }

    }$else{
        [companionName]: Kipp we really can't be here. We're gonna have to come back when we have some way of defending ourselves.
        
        Kipp and [compainonName] walked back to the hunting range.
        
        Kipp: Well now what should we do?
