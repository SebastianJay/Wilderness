go to{
	Kipp entered the @blue{abandoned treehouse}. Kipp's father built it over 10 years ago. No one had been living in the treehouse for a long time. Moss and vines surrounded the house, but it was still accessible. Kipp would have to be careful walking in the treehouse.

look around{
	Kipp looked around in the treehouse. A @yellow{family photo} and a @yellow{rifle} were hung on the wall. Kipp's father's @yellow{diary} lay on the ground. Kipp found his mother's @yellow{recipe} on the kitchen table.
