	Kipp felt a bit guilty peeking into his father's diary. The pages have turned yellow, but Kipp still managed to read it. He flipped to an interesting entry about 10 years ago.

	Dear diary,
	
	I heard the most HILARIOUS story today. I was drinking with my buddies around the campfire just now and we decided to "spice things up" a little. So we played a tree-naming game and each listed all the species of trees in the forest. Guess who lost? @green{Ol' Willy}! Turns out that the lumberjack knows nothing about his trade!
	
	So as a punishment, we asked him to tell us a secret of his. Poor @green{Ol' Willy} must've been dead drunk and he started bullshitting about the Emperor leaving a prophecy or whatever in a cave around here. The Emperor leaving a @italic{prophecy} in this middle-of-nowhere forest? Man did we laugh at @green{Ol' Willy}.
	
	We carried @green{Ol' Willy} back to his home at the @blue{lumber mill} and called it a day.
	
	
	Kipp flipped to the next entry. Some ink was spilled on the paragraph at the end, so some sentences could not be read.

	Dear diary,
	
	OMG!! THE PROPHECY IS REAL!! AND ITS BAD!!
	
	So I was doing my usual afternoon walk today and found myself wandering near the cave that the @italic{prophecy} is supposedly hidden in. So I thought, hell, why not go inside and check it out? So I went inside and walked about half an hour. As you know, I have an incredible sense of direction so I didn't lose my way. 

	After lots of twists and turns, I found an altar at the end. On it was a scroll of paper that glows in the darkness. I was scared. So I opened it and on it says: "On year XXXX, Kipp, named for The DXXXXXer in the ancient tongue, would dXXXXXX tXe ouXer world and become the neX XXXX."
	
	.......
	
	
	
	Kipp was surprised to find his name on the prophecy. What could it be? Maybe he should go to the @blue{cave} to find out.
