			Jack: That's impossible! Who are you?
			Alodar: Only the greatest magician alive *wink*

			Kipp went up to help Jack carry the logs but was stopped by Jinx.
			
			Jinx: Awww. You muggles are so @italic{adorable}. I can move it easily with a simple levitation spell. Levitus! Levitus!
			
			The pile of logs remained in its place. 
			
			Kipp: *imitating Jinx* @italic{I can move it easily with a simple levitation spell.}
			Jinx: *groans* Guess I should have paid more attention during class. Now we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way.
			
			Kipp and Jinx went up to Jack pushed to pile slowly to its intended place.
			
			Jack: *pant* Thank you friends.
			Kipp: *pant* No *pant* problem.

			Kipp: You look terrible. Need some help?
			Jack: Oh yes. 
			Rice: Hmm. I remembered a levitation spell I came across in the library. Might be helpful in this situation. Levitus!
			
			Rice waved his hand at the pile of logs. The logs shaked a bit and steadily rose up a foot above ground. Rice tried to concentrate and move the logs to his left but they just shaked in the air. Rice finally gave up and the logs dropped back to the ground.
			
			Kipp: Well, at least you tried.
			
			Kipp and Rice went up to Jack and pushed the logs slowly to their intended place.
			
			Jack: *pant* Thank you, friends.

		Kipp: Man, you sure look tired. Good luck trying to push that huge pile.
		Jack: *pants* Just shut up if you're not helping.
