		Ol' Willy: Hmm. You look awfully familiar, son. Have I met you before?
		Kipp: I don't think so. You might have met my dad though. He used to drink with the lumberjacks a lot.
		Ol' Willy: Oh! You're Johnson's boy? By god you have grown so much! So how can I help you?
		[companionName]: We're investigating something in the cave. We've heard that you know the @blue{cave} very well.
		Ol' Willy: I know it better than the wrinkles on my face. Can I know why you're going there?

			Kipp: My father told a lie to me about the forest. I want to find out why...
			
			Ol' Willy interrupted Kipp.
			
			Ol' Willy: Ok, ok. I don't want no part in your family matters. But sure, I can teach you how to navigate in the @blue{cave}. Whenever you encounter a junction, flip a coin. If it's heads, go left. If tails, go right.
			|keep it a secret|
			Kipp: I'm sorry Willy, I would rather not tell you for now.
			Ol' Willy: Fine. Sure, I can teach you how to navigate in the @blue{cave}. Whenever you encounter a junction, flip a coin. If it's heads, go left. If tails, go right.
		}
		Kipp: That sounds awfully arbitrary.
		Ol' Willy: *chuckles* It's magic, son. The Emperor put a incredibly strong spell on it so that any metal coin can act as a guide. A flipped coin would only land on a particular side before junctions.
		$if_companionD_eq_1{
			[companionName]: Destiny magic! I've only read about it in ancient scrolls. The Emperor must have been immensely powerful to perform a spell like that.
			Kipp: Destiny magic? That's a rather fancy-schmancy name for @italic{coin-flipping magic}.
			Alodar: Ohh, this is not just @italic{coin-flipping magic}. It allows you to control fate and destiny.
		}
		 $elif_companionF_eq_1{
			[companionName]: Destiny magic! I've learned that during SC 9999: Multivarible Spell-Casting! That's one of the most advanced form of magic! 
			Kipp: Destiny magic? That's a rather fancy-schmancy name for @italic{coin-flipping magic}.
			Jinx: Says someone who had never gone to magic school.
		}$elif_companionB_eq_1{
			[companionName]: Destiny magic? I've read about it in our town library. I thought it was just make-believe!
			Kipp: Destiny magic? That's a rather fancy-schmancy name for @italic{coin-flipping magic}.
			Rice: It actually had a very complex mechanism behind it. The caster would first have to warp time-space and...
			Kipp: Yeah, Yeah. Whatever.
		}
		Ol' Willy: Just trust the coin.
		Kipp: Thank you, Willy!

			ask about Willy's age|
			Kipp: Just out of curiosity, how old are you?
			Ol' Willy: To be honest, I've long lost count. I remember serving as the squire for the Emperor once. But at my age, you can no longer tell if the memories are real or just dreams.
			|ask about Willy's favorite food|
			Kipp: Just out of curiosity, what's your favorite food?
			Ol' Willy: Roasted squirrels. I love them. Used to have them every night before the authorities told me the squirrels are @italic{endangered}.

            Ol' Willy: You're a grown adult Kipp. I think you can handle...oh you probably need permission from the owner to handle it. Well sure let me write you a note.
            
            Ol' Willy dropped the log they were carrying and it fell onto Jack. Jack tried to scream from help, but his voice was muffled.
            
            Ol' Willy: Alright there good sir. One @yellow{signed note} from a good friend.
            Kipp: Thanks! Uhhh...are you going to take care of...
            Ol' Willy: Hmm... Oh no, Jack! I got you.
