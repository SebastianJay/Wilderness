        [companionName]: Kipp, why are we here?
        Kipp: Because we need some hunting training just in case something happens in this forest. I've never been around these parts before. So we can't risk it.

        Tucker: Hello, my name is @green{Tucker}. We offer free lessons on gun training, but you must provide your own weapon here. @{Talk to} @green{me} again when you're ready to train.
        Kipp: Alright, thank you sir.

    Tucker: Welcome back travelers.
    Kipp: So what should we do?
