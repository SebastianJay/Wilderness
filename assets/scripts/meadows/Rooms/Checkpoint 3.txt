				Alodar: I see why the world has favored you...
				Kipp: Yeah, I guess.
			}
			
			Kipp walks in front of [companionName], taking the lead.
			
			Kipp: Now can we get back to... @italic{bang}
			
			Kipp wasn't paying attention to the scenery around him and slams his head into a pipe.
			
			[companionName]: You do realize we are no longer in the maze, right?
			Kipp: Well that jump was quick. Where are we?
			[companionName]: Dark room, red lights all over, whistling pipers...
			Kipp: So not the exit.
			Deep Voice: So these are the new toys @italic{they} promised me...@italic{hehehehe}
			
			Kipp and [companionName] eye the corner to see a tall shadow making its way towards them. 
			As the shadow gets closer, a chainsaw began revving up as it's being dragged along metal pipes, sparking everywhere.
			
			[companionName]: I think it's best in this situation that we book it.
			Kipp: Not a bad plan.
			
			They started running in the opposite direction. After several turns and poorly made decisions, they find their way to a dead end:
			a large room with a boiler embedded into the wall.
			
			Kipp: You don't think the hedge maze can help us open a new path.
			[companionName]: Through concrete?
			Slasher: Finally, I think I've tired out my prey. Now it's time to eat...@italic{revving}
			
			[companionName] suddenly started stepping forward, confronting the slasher.
			
			$if_companionB_eq_1{
				Rice: Hey! I know killers like you are just regular people behind those masks. I've seen the movies! You don't scare me.
				
				The slasher took of his hockey mask and started smiling.
				
				Slasher: I guess I've gotta transform to my A-list role!
				
				The slasher began shaking. His body was hunched over and in an instant he was three times the size of his human form. Hair started growing from every inch of his skin. He kept growing until he reached the ceiling. Wings sprouted out from his back, claws began transforming from his hands and feet, and a majestic mane surrounded his head. A twenty foot Manticore stood before Kipp and Rice.
				
				Rice: Hey, Kipp. We're gonna need a bigger lasso.
				
			}$elif_companionF_eq_1{
				Jinx: Alright. Why don't you take off the mask and fight an enchantress like a man.
				
				The slasher took of his hockey mask and started smiling.

				The slasher began shaking. His body was hunched over and in an instant he was three times the size of his human form. Hair started growing from every inch of his skin. He kept growing until he reached the ceiling. Wings sprouted out from his back, claws began transforming from his hands and feet, and a majestic mane surrounded his head.

				Jinx: Okay, @bold{now} I regret skipping out on that monster hunting class. 
				
			}$else{
				Alodar: All of your blockbuster effects are transparent. You don't stand a chance against a derelict and the chosen one!
				
				The slasher took of his hockey mask and started smiling.
				
				Slasher: I'm glad you said that. Now the real horror film can start!
				
				The slasher began shaking. His body was hunched over and in an instant he was three times the size of his human form. Hair started growing from every inch of his skin. He kept growing until he reached the ceiling. Wings sprouted out from his back, claws began transforming from his hands and feet, and a majestic mane surrounded his head. A twenty foot Manticore stood before Kipp and Alodar.
				
				Alodar: Kipp, I don't think looks are deceiving.
				
			}
			
			The manticore then grabs [companionName] keeps a tight grip on them.
			
			[companionName]: Kipp, the demon is crushing every bone in my body! You've got to do something!
			
			@bold_orange{It would be in your best interest to save here. Oh wait, the choice is coming up right now...good luck :)}

			Save your own skin|
				Kipp had to play the odds. He knew there's little to chance of saving both of them. Kipp bolted around the monster has he's busy with [companionName], whose struggling through the pain.
				
				[companionName]: Wait, what about me?!
				Manticore: Still got some steam in ya, huh kid?
				
				Kipp focused on retracing their path and heading in the other direction to find a way to leave this dimension.
				
				Manticore: There's no such thing as an exit here and you ain't going nowhere. 
				
				Kipp's options kept narrowing down with every new path he tried. His breath got heavier, his heart kept beating faster and faster. The manticore's voice was muffling and the room kept getting darker, but Kipp was still running. Like a wall, Kipp's body just stopped all of a sudden. The scene blacks out.
				
				Kipp wakes up in a sweat, back to safety in the hedge maze.
				
				[companionName]: So, did you finally think of a reason why you left me back there?
				Kipp: I'm sorry. I was thinking about myself for a moment. Are you in any mood of forgiving?
				[companionName]: Ask me again once we find a way out of here, coward.
				Kipp: Kay...
				
				[companionName] moves on ahead without Kipp, opening the four paths of light at the intersection.

				Kipp can't just leave them now after all they've been through. He notices the whistling boiler behind him.
				
				Kipp: Hey, mammoth. You may be stronger but I bet you'll still miss.
				
				The monster takes a look back at Kipp and swings his hand forward, trying to toss him to the wall. Kipp leaps back.
				
				Kipp: See, I've seen better swings on my grandma's porch.
				Manticore: You're really pressing your luck...
				
				The manticore took another swing at Kipp rolled to the right to keep his attention.

				Kipp: Make sure you're swinging hard, just in case you actually hit me!
				
				The manticore dropped [companioniName], allowing them to run away. The manticore pulled out its claws and viciously swung at Kipp. Kipp inched closer and closer to the boiler with every dodge.
				
				Kipp took a few steps behind him until he felt the heat of the boiler.
				
				Kipp: No wonder the maze left a killer with no bite in here.
				Manticore: @bold{ROAAAAAAAAAAAR!}
				
				As the manticore took its final swing Kipp ducked and rolled forward. The manticore's claws dug into the metal door of the boiler. The steam blasted the manticore's face. The blasted boiler steamed up the room, blinding Kipp. He started running to catch up with [companionName].
				
				Kipp: Hey [companionName], I took care of the manticore. [companionName]?
				
				The fog fades as Kipp finds himself back in the maze. He sees [companionName] get up from the ground.
				
				[companionName]: Thanks for getting back there. I thought I had no chance after I was grabbed...@italic{ow}.
				Kipp: Are you alr...
				[companionName]: Yeah, I'll be okay. Just give me some time to walk it off.
				
				Kipp: Okay, I'll get this maze thing settled.
