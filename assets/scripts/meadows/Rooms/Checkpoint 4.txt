			[companionName] was silent.

			Kipp: Hey, I thought the whole last checkpoint was all said and done?

			Kipp took a blow to the head and was knocked out.


			A wave of heat blasts Kipp's face as he regains consciousness.

			Kipp: Man, I could go for some lemonade right now. Ahh! Why is the ground so hot?

			Kipp looked up to see that he was on the edge of a cliff. Below him, a pool of lava sat there bubbling.

			Voice: Kipp help!
			Kipp: Crap, [companionName]?!
			[companionName]: It wasn't me, Kipp.
			Voice: Over here!

			Kipp looked over the horizon to see his dad hanging over the edge of a cliff.

			Kipp: Oh man. Dad! I'm coming to get you!

			Kipp got up and ran as fast as he could so he can to reach him.

			Kipp: Don't worry everything is gonna be fine.
			Father: How dare you leave the farm.
			Kipp: What?
			Father: I don't think I can hold on any longer!
			[companionName]: Kipp what are you doing? We can't stand around.
			Kipp: But didn't you just hear that?
			Father: Why couldn't you just follow your brother.
			[companionName]: Hear what?
			Kipp: That!
			[companionName]: Kipp even if you're losing it right now, you're father still in danger...
			Kipp: But...whatever!

			Kipp kept running and the voices didn't stop.

			Father: I am ashamed of you...you have to grow up someday...you don't deserve to be a part of this family.
			Father: Kipp, you've got to hurry!
			Kipp: Argh...what's going on!

			Save Father|
				Kipp: Blood is thicker than water Kipp, and I ain't gonna get another one.

				Kipp pressed harder against the ground and picked up his pace. A plume of lava began rushing under the father's feet. Kipp took his dad's arm and tugged him up before the pillar of fire consumed him.

				Father: Thanks, Kipp. You were always a good kid.

				Kipp tried smiling through all of his exhaustion. Kipp passed out due to his fatigue. The world went dark.

			|Leave Him|
				Kipp stopped and dug his heels into the ground.

				Kipp: Why am I even doing this? It's my life, it's my decisions. He can take his anger and disappointment to his grave.

				A sharp noise penetrated Kipp's eardrums. The whole world crumbled around Kipp. Lava rose between the cracks in the earth. A large chuck of rock broke from the ceiling. Before Kipp was crushed by the boulder, the entire scene went dark.

			[companionName]: So what now?
			Kipp: I'll read the plaque, "@red{go to} @blue{Checkpoint }[medHedgeCheck]. Don't make me tear open the room of a thousand demons."
