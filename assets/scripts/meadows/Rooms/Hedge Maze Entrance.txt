		Kipp: So we go left.
		[companionName]: No she said the maze was a little more to the right.
		Kipp: We've been leaning towards the right for half an hour. I say we balance it out and try going left. We've probably passed it by now.
		[companionName]: You do understand we haven't even reach the maze yet and we're already lost.
		Kipp: Don't remind me.
		# FOR ANYONE WHO IS READING THE SOURCE FILES OF THIS GAME. I HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE MY LEVELS ARE BASICALLY ME WRITING FULL-BLOWN NOVELS. IF THE REST OF THE LEVEL FROM HERE ON OUT IS WRITTEN STUPIDLY, I CAN ONLY BLAME MYSELF :P
		Sheep: Baaaahhhh!
		
		Kipp and [compaionName] look at each other and dart straight for the noise. They arrive to a large wall made completely out of shrubs.
		
		Sheep: Baaaahhhh!
		Kipp: Well they're definitely in that maze, but we can't just breach through this dense shrubbery.
		[companionName]: Let's walk around and try to find an entrance.
		Kipp: On the same wavelength for once.
		
		They walk around the perimeter of the maze, which only took a short stroll to reach the other side. 
		
		Kipp: I swear the noise echoed. This maze has to be bigger.
		[compaionName]: Perhaps it's one of those "small in appearance, but larger on the inside" types of rooms.
		
		The walls are too tall to see what's on the other side. [companionName] eventually finds a sign next to the entrance.
		
		[companionName]: Hey, Kipp. The sign says, "BEGIN YOUR QUESTION BY TYPING IN @red{GO TO} @blue{CHECKPOINT 1}". Man, by the time this game ends, we'll have to build a new fourth wall.
		Kipp: I guess we have no choice. Time to walk in.
		[companionName]: Trusting the creepy glowing sign to guide us to safety. What can go wrong?

		Kipp: Well we're back here, again.
		[companionName]: I wonder if one of these portals will bring us to the end of the game?
		Kipp: Stop messing with the player. Don't get his or her hopes up.
		[companionName]: Just a thought. Hey player, there's a sign here that says that we should @red{go to} @blue{Checkpoint }[medHedgeCheck]. Jumping ahead or going back will get us tossed back to the entrance. We could also @red{go to} the @blue{Shepherd House} if you're bored with this guy's play-through.
		Kipp: Wait, that's my job... whatever just listen to [companionName].
