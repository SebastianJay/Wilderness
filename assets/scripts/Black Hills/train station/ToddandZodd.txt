            Todd and Zodd: Sure!
            The three of them worked together and carried the chunk of marble off the train.
            Todd and Zodd: Thanks a bunch buddy! Are you staying in town for a while?
            Kipp: Yeah. I'm about to check out this place.
            Todd and Zodd: It's a bad time to be in @blue{Black Hills}. A @yellow{Demon} is wrecking havoc in our @blue{mines}. 5 miners are already injured and sent to the @blue{hospital}.
            Kipp: !!!
            Todd and Zodd: Anyway, have these @yellow{medicine} just in case. We gotta go back to work.
            Kipp: Thank you!

    The twin brothers seemed to be natives of @blue{Black Hills}. Perhaps they can tell Kipp more about the town.
