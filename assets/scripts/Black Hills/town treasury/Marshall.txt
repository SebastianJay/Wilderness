		Marshall: Ahh, I know just the perfect solution. The Dragonskin Boots we have is known for its resilience. However, you must first pass the Test of Integrity to prove your worthiness.

		Marshall: Yes. The Dragonskin Boots are a rare and precious treasure. We must know that you can resist the temptation to steal it.
