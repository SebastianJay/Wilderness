        Marshall: Sir, I have word from my superior, Dru. If you step any closer to the premises, I am legally obligated to put you to jail...
        
        The Marshall took out a letter he was given from Dru.
        
        Marshall: ...for life, plus 50 years. Apparently for life expectancy around here is about 20 years on average. We really have to do something about those freak accidents.
        
        Yup, really not welcomed around these parts. Kipp didn't take a second thought before he walked straight back to the @blue{hospital}.
        
        Kipp: Well after siding with the bad guys, you'd expect to see this coming.
