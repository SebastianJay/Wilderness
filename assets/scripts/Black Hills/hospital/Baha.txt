	Kipp: How are you today?
	Baha: Good. The doctors told me I'll be able to walk normally soon.
	Kipp: That's wonderful! I have a favor to ask, though. Can you tell me more about the "demon"?
	Baha: *sigh* I would rather not. They still gave me nightmares.
	Kipp: I understand...
	Baha: No, you don't! You haven't seen it!

		Kipp: You're right. But now we have the opportunity to get rid of it once and for all. But I'll need your help to search for its weakness.
		Baha: I don't know...
		Kipp: Come on, man. We can do this. 
		Baha: Alright, lemme think. The "demon" was stunned when Dru threw a bottle of moonshine at it. You can probably use moonshine to defeat it.
		Kipp: Moonshine? The newspapers said it was a bottle of water!
		Baha: *grin* Well, ain't gonna let the boss know that!
		Kipp: Thank you Baha.

		Kipp: This isn't about you, italic{whiner}. Hundreds of lives are at stake. Tell me EVERYTHING, NOW!
		Baha: *sobs* Okay. Lemme think. The "demon" was stunned when Dru threw a bottle at it...
		Kipp: A bottle of WHAT? Stop wasting my time and get on with it!
		Baha: A bottle of moonshine... Please don't tell our bosses about this...
		Kipp: *grin* We'll see.

		|Comfort Baha|
		Kipp: You're right. I was being inconsiderate, you must have been through a lot. 
		Baha: I could have died there, if it wasn't for Dru. I could have italic{died}.
		Kipp: If you don't want to talk, it's fine. I guess I was being too rash just now. I just wanted to solve the problem so bad.
		Baha: I'm sorry that I was so emotional just now. You were just trying to help. Now that I think of it, I remember that Dru's moonshine stopped the "demon".
		Kipp: Wow! That is some valuable information. Thank you!
