   	Kipp heard the sirens wailing as an ambulance pulled over at the @blue{hospital}.@green{Kru}, a miner and @green{Dru}'s brother, was carried into the @blue{hospital} on a stretcher.A crowd gathered at the hospital, including @green{Conney} and @green{Dru}

    	Nurse Rani: Make way! Injured person coming through!
	Dru: NOO! Not an another attack! Is Kru alright? I want to see him!
    	Conney: What is going on? Let me in!

 	Both @green{Conney} and @green{Dru} followed the injured @green{Kru} until they were stopped at the emergency room.
    
	Nurse Rani: I'm sorry gentleman, this room is for medical staff only.
	Conney: Missy, I don't think you understand the situation. My million dollar business is at stake!
	
	@green{Dru}, who was waiting anxiously by the side, suddenly erupted like volcano. 

	Dru: No one gives a darn about your million gazillion business! We are dying down there!
	Conney: You, for one, should care because my company puts bread on your table!

	No one else in the room dared to make a sound. Kipp decided to step in.

		|Kipp: Dru's right, Conney. If you don't deal with the problem, we will take it into our own hands. 
		Conney: How do you solve a problem where there isn't one. I just told you that these are just routine accidents.
		Kipp: We'll see, Conney. We'll see.
		
		The crowd roared and jeered at the embarassed @green{Conney}.

		@green{Conney} left the @blue{hospital} in anger and slammed the door.

		Dru: Good job buddy! Why don't we head to the Town Treasury and make a plan.
		Kipp: Sounds like a plan.

		|Root for Conney|
		Kipp: I'm afraid I'll have to side with Mr. Conney, Dru. Your theory of "demons" is so full of loopholes.
		Dru: What?
		Conney: Finally, now this is someone with a brain.
		
		The crowded started to murmur as they overcame the initial shock. 
		
		Town folk A: The kid's mad.
		Town folk B: Get out of our town you ass-kisser!
		Dru: You're no longer welcome in the town, Kipp. Better gather your stuff and leave.

		Kipp ignored the crowd.

		Kipp: Mr. Conney, why don't we talk in private?
		Conney: Sure, find me at the @blue{mining warehouse}. We won't be interrupted there.
