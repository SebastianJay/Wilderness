        Dru: Not good, man. The mines are already closed due to the accidents. I hope they kill the Demon soon or my family would go hungry. 
        Kipp: Accidents? What happened?
        Dru: A Demon attacked us from the darkness in the mines. I narrowly escaped but my friends were hurt. They are still in the @blue{hospital} now.
