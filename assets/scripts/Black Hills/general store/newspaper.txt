    The Demon: Myth or Fact?

    An exclusive report brought to you by the Black Hills Times.

    On June 14, 6 of our beloved townfolks went down the mines to work just like usual. Unbeknownst to them, they would soon by attacked by the "Demon", a creature the size of an orangutan. 5 of them suffered cuts to the lower bodies and remain hospitalized in the @blue{hospital}, while one person @green{Dru} miraculously stayed unscathed and saved his friends' lives. . 
    Let's hear it from Dru, our hero: 
    Dru: I just threw my water bottle at the Demon. The bottle crashed and the Demon let out a sizzling sound and stopped moving. I managed to run out for help and got my fellows out before the Demon attacked again.
    Meanwhile, Conney the owner of the local mining company is denying the existences of the Demon completely:
    Conney: Some rocks fell from above and hit the miners. It happens all the time in other mines. Demons? Come on people!
