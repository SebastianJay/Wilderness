			Threaten Widowmaker|
			Kipp wrapped his hands around Widowmakers throat. Shotgun Pete saw that and drew out his gun at Kipp.
	
			Shotgun Pete: Get your dirty hands off Widowmaker or you'll regret it.

			Kipp pushed Widowmaker into Shotgun Pete, blocking the vision of Pete. He then drew out his corrosive gun and pointed it at Shotgun Pete.
			
			Kipp: I regret nothing. Now gimme the password.

			Shotgun Pete was distracted for a second but Kipp has already gotten the upper hand.
	
			Shotgun Pete: Fine. Tell him the password.
			Widowmaker: It's "UCRJA".

			|Trick the Widowmaker into giving the password|
			Kipp: I've already gotten the password.
			Widowmaker: What? So fast?
			Kipp: Of course! This password is so @italic{amateur}.
			Widowmaker: Don't be ridiculous. The set of numbers each refers to the row and column of letters in the @yellow{book}. This is advanced encryting!
			Kipp: *grin* I see.

			Kipp checked the @yellow{book} and decrypted the password: "UCRJA"

			Kipp: I'm not good at numbers and stuff. Can you help me with it?
			Widowmaker: Of course you don't. This password is my masterpiece!
			Kipp: Then I'll never solve it on my own! Can you help me please?
			Widowmaker: *shrug* Fine. The set of numbers each refers to the row and column of letters in the @yellow{book}.

			Kipp checked the @yellow{book} and decrypted the password: "UCRJA"

			Kipp: Thank you!
