		Kipp opened the lock. He got on the train and set off into the darkness.
		
		Kipp arrived at the @blue{mines}. He heard some faint creaking noises from the distance. It must be the demon.

			Kipp got into a protective suit and started pumping the corrosive gas into the mines. The mines was soon filled with the yellowish-green fumes. The gas was so strong that even some coal on the surface was dissolving. Kipp could hear the sizzling sound as the "demon" was dissolving in the depth of the mines. Suddenly, the noise became louder and clearer. The injured "demon" was rushing to Kipp to attack him. Kipp grabbed the tank of corrosive gas and poured it onto the "demon". He caught only a glimpse of it before it dissolved almost instantly. But Kipp would never forgot what he had seen: a shiny metal body that had come to life. The "demon" was definitely not from this world, Kipp concluded.

			Kipp took out his gun and ventured into the depth of the mines. He could hear the soft creaking of the "demon" in the distance. He followed the sound quietly. The creaking became louder and louder. Suddenly, a shiny metal box leapt up to Kipp from the darkness, its blades slashing at Kipp. Kipp barely managed to duck away before firing an endless barrage of corrosive bullets at the "demon". Soon the "demon" was no longer moving. It lay dead on the ground. Kipp examined it closer: it was just like a metal box. A metal box with a soul and mind of its own. Kipp shuddered at that thought. Whatever that it, Kipp concluded that it is definitely not from this world.

		Kipp went back to Conney and claimed his rewards. But Kipp was no longer concerned about the money. The image of the "demon" was stuck in his brain. Kipp went back to the @blue{train station} and decided to leave the @blue{Black Hills}, excited and nervous about the adventures ahead.
