		Yes|
			Kipp: Yes I know that. He told me a million times. Nobody knows when @blue{Charli} was formed. This large farm was constructed by my maternal grand grandfather and when dad married mom, he inherited the farm and has lived here ever after. @blue{Charli} was at the far side of the Wilderness. Here, farm and harvest is the theme of life. Residents here live such peaceful lives that man slaughtering monsters and great magicians are considered the wildest lore to fascinate children.
			Rice: Ok...you know a lot. Do you know why dad came here? Let me tell you. He lost his parents, and having nowhere to go, he took the only option they gave him and planned his new life on the farm. The rural life was different. At the start, my dad had no clue what he was doing. The neighbor's kid would sit on the old post and laugh at him. Eventually she would take pity on him and show him how it was done. Days would pass and this became a regular thing. In the end, that girl taught that city boy how to farm. She would still think that he was different, but I guess it was a good different. My dad says that their relationship would only get better from there. He said that too for the rest of the town. He felt for the first time his life was stable, that he had a place to call home.
