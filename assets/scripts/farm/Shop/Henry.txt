			Kipp: What a coincidence Uncle Henry, I happen to have fresh milk. (Show you milk container) Wanna buy some? 
			Owner: sure, here is 50 cents for you, my little boy. Oh here is a map one bugger gave to me in exchange for 2 bread yesterday. He was bragging about finding treasure through the map. Why don¡¯t him go find it himself. Anyway, thought you might be interested.
