  Kipp and [companionName] take a few steps into the light. They walk out to find themselves at another intersection.

  Kipp: Alright, seems like I am somewhat good on my own. Now where to next?

  Kipp shields his eyes before the light starts coming from all ends of the maze.

  Kipp: Yup. Use to that, too.

  Kipp and [companionName] take a few steps into the light. They walk out to find themselves at another intersection.

  Kipp: And another one down on the first try! It's magic...or again, the level designer got lazy.

  Kipp: Alright last one. Choose wisely Kipp.

  Kipp and [companionName] take a few steps into the light. They walk out to find themselves at, once more, a dead end.

  Kipp: Look. At. Me. Did it all in one shot. Who's the best? I think it's me.

  [companionName]: Congratulations you learned how to pick the same direction three times in a row. Someone should give you a cookie...ow.

  It looks like [companionName] is still slightly bruised from their encounter with the manticore.

  Kipp: We at least I get this plaque.

  "Congratulations! You have made it through the third checkpoint. Please proceed to @blue{Checkpoint 4}"

  Kipp: There's still more maze to @red{go to}?!

  The plaque started morphing its letting and moving them around: "Do not fret. I will not make you do this path choosing simulator anymore."

  [companionName]: Even the game is on to the adequate designing of this level.
