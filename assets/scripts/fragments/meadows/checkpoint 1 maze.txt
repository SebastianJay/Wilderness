  Kipp and [companionName] take a few steps into the light. They walk out to find themselves at another intersection.

  Kipp: ...
  [companionName]: Well, we're still in the maze. I count that as a plus.
  Kipp: So now what?

  A flash of light shines in all four directions.

  Kipp: I think the maze is telling us something.
  [companionName]: Or trying to blind us for good.
  Kipp: Doesn't matter, where do you want to head next?

  Kipp: ...
  [companionName]: Hey, two for two.
  Kipp: One more time?
  [companionName]: These things are normally built in threes, unless the level designer decided to screw us over.

  A flash of light shines in all four directions.

  Kipp: Note to self, never build a maze that comes with a seizure warning.

  Kipp and [companionName] take a few steps into the light. They walk out to find themselves at a dead end.

  Kipp: Wait what does a room with no exits mean?
  [companionName]: That we're going to die in here.
  Kipp: Well, theres a silver plaque on the wall.

  The plaque on the wall read, "Congratulations! You have made it through the first checkpoint. Please proceed to @blue{Checkpoint 2}"

  Kipp: @red{go to} there I guess?
  [companionName] shrugs.

  A portion of the wall opens up for Kipp and [companionName] to walk through.
