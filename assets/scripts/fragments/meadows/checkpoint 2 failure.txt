Kipp and [companionName] take a few steps into the light. They walk out to find themselves back at the @blue{Hedge Maze Entrance}.

Kipp: Well great.
[companionName]: %25 percent chance of getting it right! Literally 1 out of 4, Kipp!
Kipp: Don't blame me. So now what?
[companionName]: We walk back in. Another option is give up and just go back to the @blue{Shepherd} 's @blue{House} and tell Sam we didn't sign up for this, take a nap, do something more interesting.
Kipp: Or...we can try that walk back in idea and try again, (@red{go to } @blue{Checkpoint 1}).
[companionName]: I'll let you decide @bold{all on your own} so you can't blame me next time.
