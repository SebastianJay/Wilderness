A text adventure game developed by Student Game Developers at the University of Virginia in the fall of 2016.

### Concept
The game features two protagonists in two different storylines as they each make their way to the Wilderness, the site of a growing sinkhole that threatens to consume the planet. Players make progress by typing freeform commands to talk to NPCs, manipulate inventory, and traverse rooms.
