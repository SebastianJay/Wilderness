		Kipp: Well I did find this tomahawk. It may be a little worn, but...
		Akecheta: Wait a second, is this? Ma-Zoo! I thought I told you to always keep you weapon by your side!
		This is the third one this month!
		
		Ma-Zoo smiled and just whistled in the background.
		
		Akecheta: This will have to do. Now, using the @yellow{base} of our ancestors' knowledge, carve @orange{31} markings
		into the totem pole beside the vault. This is what you will carve.
		#31 in base 8 is 25 in base 10
		
		Kipp: @italicic{(to himself)} The base of his ancestory? Man, I hope the @blue{library} has something on this.
		
		Akecheta proceeded to show Kipp what symbol Kipp will draw.
		Kipp practiced on the wall to make sure he was doing it correctly.
		
		Kipp: I think I got it.
		Akecheta: Good. When you're ready, @red{use} the @yellow{tomahawk} @red{on} the @yellow{totem pole} to begin your task.
		You only have one chance. Once you start using your blade, you won't be able to back out, and remember...
		
		Akecheta nodded his head once more. Kipp turned around to see Kala and Ma-Zoo smash a hole in the wall before grinning back
		at Kipp.
		
		Kipp: *Gulp*
