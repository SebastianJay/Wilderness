			Kipp: If this all doesn't go well, at least my parents won't have to pay to cremate my body.
			Actually I think mom wanted my body burried behind the house. I guess it's too late to start
			thinking about my parents' wishes.
			
			Kipp stared down at the fire ale in his hand. He closed his eyes and began chugging half the bottle.
			He expected such a dose would either give him enough power or kill him on the spot. He waited a second.
			Welp, the latter didn't happen so Kipp rushed up to the forge to release the intense pressure building up
			in his body.
			
			It was the first time kipp was able to look straight into the fire for more than a second without
			freaking out. His body was still tensed up, but he wasn't going to walk away. The fire roared with the sound
			of a thousand screams. Kipp concentrated on the fire. He may not have been an enchanter, but the mana from
			the potion must have given him temporary powers and he saw the number 53 somewhere in the flames.
			Kipp thought to himself.
			
			Kipp: Right, Mohani said the powers I had could overcome hers if I just hold this stream of fire for @yellow{53} seconds.
			I know she's playing games. 53 won't be the answer. I just have to think a little harder.

				#FAIL, HELD THE FIRE FOR TOO LONG
				
				Kipped panicked to think of anything. Once a number popped up in his head he opened his eyes and
				let his mouth release the @blue{blue} flames within him. The spell retaliated and sent its @red{red}
				flames back at Kipp. Spectators outside the shop could see a ball of red and blue light emmit from
				the gunsmith shop. Everyone in the room shielded their eyes. 
				
				After about half a minute, Mohani lifted her eyes to see Kipp still shooting flames into the forge.
				She began grinning.
				
				Kipp's lungs were burning, but the adrenaline in his body allowed him to endure the pain.
				Seconds later, the spell in the forge began changing.
				Kipp tried squinting to see what was happening past his stream of fire. The forge had stopped resisting,
				but the spell has started fusing its energy with Kipp's power. The ball of light in the forge started growing
				and in an instant...the forge blew up. The shrapnel seemed directed only towards Kipp (magic huh). Everyone else
				was already given a signal to duck and hide from Kipp's mess. Mohani rose to see a line of char down the room and
				a circle of ashes where Kipp was standing.
				
				Mohani: Alright everyone, clean up this mess. Let's now take care of Rowen.

				#FAIL, DIDN'T HOLD THE FIRE LONG ENOUGH
				
				Kipp's mind was filled with too many numbers. He couldn't concentrate hard enough, but when he was able to come
				up with a distinct number, he started to unleash the @blue{blue} flames he was holding inside of him. The spell in the 
				forge retaliated with its @red{red} streams of inferno. The crossed streams formed a light strong enough to blind everyone
				in the room.
				
				Kipp held his stand for as long as he could, and when he couldn't take it anymore, he closed his mouth and gasped for air.
				Well, at least Kipp held it for [ntoSeconds] seconds. Mohani grinned.
				
				The spell didn't seem to be weakened. In fact, the flames spilled out of the forge. The fire grew into the shape of a griffin
				The griffin spread it's wings and then dove straight at Kipp. Kipp tried to shield his body, but it was no use.
				The fire impacted with the strength of a meteorite and burned everything within its path. Once the bird disappeared, 
				at that was left was a trail of smoke and burnt floorboards down the store.
				
				Mohani was right, Kipp didn't die by her hands. 
			
			
				@bold{GAME OVER}
				$gameover
			}$else{
				#SUCCESS
				
				Kipp focused with everything he got. Once he had a clear number in his mind he opened his mouth.
				A great @blue{blue} ball of flame, much more intense than any of the previous times the fire ale was used,
				project from his mouth into the forge. The flame Mohani casted sprung from the forge, knowing it
				was being assailed. The @red{red} flame matched the intensity of Kipp's powers. Everyone in the room gasped at
				the scene taking place. It was like they were all watching a reenactment of last duel in that 
				G.A. Bowling series everyone had read. Mohani leaned towards her henchmen.
				
				Mohani: Yup, I'm impressed he had it in him. Let's just see if he can follow through.
				
				Kipp had never exhaled his breath for this long. His lungs felt like they were on fire. He could
				give out at any second, but he was counting in his head until he reached that magic number.
				After 33 seconds, he closed his mouth and tried to relieve himself. The fire in the forge was screaming
				again, but this time its pitch got higher and higher. The energy looked like it was ready to explode.
				Moments later, a gust of purple wind ejected from the forge in all directions. Everyone held their place
				and braced the winds, except for the exhausted Kipp who flew back and hit the wall. He dropped what was
				left of the fire ale onto the floor and the bottle shattered.
				
				As the wind continued to gust, Mohani's eyes started glowing brighter. Her teeth were grinding as she tried to
				withstand the pain. Mohani's will was too strong and the little creature in her head had no choice but to leave
				her brain. Once the wind subsided and Mohani opened her eyes to see the tiny little parasite crawling on the floor
				she built into a rage. She casted a spell at the parasite so that it died a slow and painful death. Mohani regained her
				cool and walked up to Kipp, still dazed on the floor.
				
				Mohani: Hey, Kipp. I owe you one. That little low life raided our group as we were trying to raid this ruin a few miles west.
				Next thing I knew my body was forcing me to abandon the mission and walk towards the middle of nowhere until we met up with
				our boss, Rowen, and the two other gangs. He would have dragged me around till the bitter end. 
				
				Mohani: I understand this whole coup you're trying to set up here. So I guess I'll join it as long as that little parasite in Rowen's
				head get's smashed into pieces. I honestly don't care if it's still in Rowen's head when that happens. That would actually be a plus.
				@yellow{I'll wait for your signal and we'll be there to kick his butt.} @italic{(with a smile)} See ya later Abhay. #name in Sanskrit for fearless.
				
				Kipp was still unconcious, but I guess the narrator will catch him up with the situation later. Where to next?

		Kipp: Nope, I am not going near the fire until I have a way of fighting back.
		
		The fire responded by forming tiny little balls of flames in the form of imps. They all started laughing at Kipp's cowardness.
