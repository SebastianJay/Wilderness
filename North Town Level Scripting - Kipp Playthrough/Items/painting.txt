		Kipp: It looks like a dog dressed as a human as he pours another dog a drink. Weird.
		I would have expected this art to fit in the saloon.  The designer of this level must have gotten lazy with this plot design.  *Level design shrugs*
		Still, something about this piece doesn't look right. 																			
		Maybe a closer look will help.

		Kipp looked closer at the drink to see the glass in the picture start illuminating.
		Kipp: Wait, is that drink glowing? I have to study this further.

		Kipp: Hey, Akecheta. Do you guys need this painting.
		Akecheta: We don't understand this town's art style. Do what you wish.
		
		Kipp pressed his hand around the painting, solid. then he pressed his hand on the glowing light and felt nothing behind
		it. 
		
		Kipp:Maybe there's a open space. Like in those books about murders and investigations.
		
		Kipp ripped open the painting to find a potion hiding in the indention of the wall illuminated by a colored spotlight installed
		in the top. Kipp took a closer look. It read: "Fire Ale. Gives you the spirit of a fire breathing dragon." It had a picture of 
		a firedrake with his eyes closed. #Firedrake: Fire breathing dragon from Germanic Mythology. Also a species of dragon in Lord of the Rings.
		
		Kipp: It might just be another ad trick.
		
		Kipp hesitantly took a sip of the drink and...nope nothing. Moments later about a burst of heat rose through his throat.
		Kipp tried covering his mouth, but the heat was too much. He opened to scream, but instead a great ball of fire expelled from
		his body. Kipp stared back at the bottle to look at the picture. The dragon eyes have opened and its mouth was spewing fire decoratively 
		like vines all over the bottle. Kipp knew he was playing with magic. Akecheta leaned in to whisper at Kala.
		
		Akecheta: I think that boy, Kipp, is pure witchcraft. How shameful.
		
		Kala shook his head with his eyes closed. @bold{*Fire Ale Added to Inventory*}
