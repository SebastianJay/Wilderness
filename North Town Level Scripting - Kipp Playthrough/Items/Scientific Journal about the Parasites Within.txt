	Kipp: Weird, this doesn't look like it comes from our world. 
	
	Kipp opened to the back of the book.
	
	"About the Author: Doctor Dwindle Carvin is a world renound microbiologist who now teaches as a professor at the University
					   of Corvone. He's made scientific breakthroughts in the existence and nature of microorganisms in the most
					   extreme environments in the @orange{Outer World}"
	
	Kipp: Is this a piece of science fiction?
	
	Kipp started flipping through the book and stopped on the page with a picture of a green glowing organism.
	
	"The Neuro-Heterotroph. They are classified as organisms that feeds on another organism's brain, more specifically the cerebrum. These parasites
	 are only able to sustain life on a minuscule scale, some as small as a strand of DNA. Scientists have obtained samples of parasites
	 the size of earthworms, but they are only able to survive for long periods of time in lab controlled environments. 
	 Through genetic engineering, @orange{scientists have been able to manipulate these parasites so that they can grow from their micro state and be seen 
	 from the naked eye in a matter of days. Their bodies have also changed so that they can live in normal environments as long as they are attached to a host.} 
	 Through repeated studies, the parasites have shown to take over the host's bodies, from thinking process to muscular movements, within a few weeks. 
	 
	 Kipp: This could never exist in our world.
	 
	 "No traces of these parasites have known to exist in the in the region called 'Inner World' for the past 1000 years. The last known location of the facilites
	 that handle the growth of these parasites was in the region past the radioactive wasteland, isolated from human civilization."
	 
	 Kipp closed the book and put it back on the self.
