#NOT AN ACTUAL ROOM FILE. THIS IS WHERE THE LEVEL WILL START ONCE NORTH TOWN IS LOADED. ONCE KIPP ESCAPES TO THE LIBRARY HE CAN NOT RETURN HERE.
#INTRODUCION TO ASPIRE
It has been days since Kipp has seen a town. He has mentally trained himself to embrace the emptiness of isolation
on his journey, but nothing could have prepared him for a sense of loneliness like this.
The sunlight has grown oddly intense. The world beneath Kipp's feet has dried up. With every step, Kipp's bones start to grind harder and 
pain in your joints soon follow. The craving for water drenches Kipp's mind, but all signs of water have withered away.

A few miles later, Kipp's line of sight picked up something laying on the ground. Upon further inspection,
he noticed that it's a sign to a town. It reads, "Welcome to @blue{Aspire!} Home of the frontier!"
Kipp has finally reached hope of civilization! It felt so promising, except for the fact that there were bullets, knives, and horshoe prints 
buried all over the sign. Kipp felt that this town might be too dangerous, but then he shouted with spirit, "This is an adventure! I have to embrace every
danger that comes my way, and there is no turning back now."  He then began to march toward the general directions of town center.
Looking around all he saw were buildings with windows boarded up, what looked to be outlaws loitering around the town with guns and an urge to
start a fight, and innocent townspeople being yelled at, "keep moving along!" It wasn't a pretty sight, but then something profound caught his eye: a water pump!

Kipp darts for the pump and fills his mouth with fresh water. His body is relieved and all is well again. Kipp then decided to take out his bottle so that he can have
more water for the trip. As he was filling his bottle, a shadow began to block the sunlight beneath his feet. Next thing Kipp saw was a foot swinging towards his head.
Kipp jumped back and his bottle dropped to the ground, spilling everywhere.

Unknown Voice: What do you think you are doing in my town.

Kipp looked up to see a tall, muscular male to match such an intimidating voice.

Kipp: Um nothing sir. Just filling up my bottle and I'll be on my way.
Unknown Voice: I don't think you know where your place is.
Rowen: 	My name is Rowen, and I am the ringleader of this here circus we call Aspire.
We have criminals lurking all over this town, so don't you think you can't get away with anything.
To make sure you understand, let me teach you a lesson.
There are two kinds of people I don't like: those who question my authority and those who go dirtying my town with their saliva.
Kipp: Oh I didn't mean to disgrace your town. Um...your eyes, sir.

Kipp noticed that Rowen's eyes have started emiting a green glow that keeps getting brigther as Rowen's rage grows.
Rowen: Clodhopper, I think you are asking for a shoe in your mouth right about now. @bold{I swear I won't miss again.}

Just then, a little boy comes running towards Kipp.

Child: 	Sorry, sir. This is my cousin. He is visiting here and my mother asked him to take care of me. He sometimes gets lost in a town this size. 
I promise on my grandpappy's grave that a thing like this won't happen again.
Rowen: 	@italic{(Scoffing)} It better not.

Arthur directs his attention towards Kipp.

Arthur: @italic{(Whispering)} "Hi, I'm Arthur! We should probably find a safer place to talk."
Kipp: Wait. Why are you helping me?
Arthur: @italic{(Whispering)} "I'll explain later. We have to @red{go to} the @blue{library), right now!"
